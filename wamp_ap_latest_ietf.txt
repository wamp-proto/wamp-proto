1.  WAMP Advanced Profile

   While all implementations MUST implement the subset of the Basic
   Profile necessary for the particular set of WAMP roles they provide,
   they MAY implement any subset of features from the Advanced Profile.
   Implementers SHOULD implement the maximum of features possible
   considering the aims of an implementation.

   |  Note: Features listed here may be experimental or underspecced and
   |  yet unimplemented in any implementation.  This part of the
   |  specification is very much a work in progress.  An approximate
   |  status of each feature is given at the beginning of the feature
   |  section.

1.1.  Feature Announcement

   Support for advanced features must be announced by the peers which
   implement them.  The following is a complete list of advanced
   features currently defined or proposed.

1.2.  Additional Messages

   The Advanced Profile defines additional WAMP-level messages which are
   explained in detail in separate sections.  The following 4 additional
   message types MAY be used in the Advanced Profile and their direction
   between peer roles.  Here, "Tx" ("Rx") means the message is sent
   (received) by a peer of the respective role.

1.2.1.  CHALLENGE

   The CHALLENGE message is used with certain Authentication Methods.
   During authenticated session establishment, a *Router* sends a
   challenge message.

       [CHALLENGE, AuthMethod|string, Extra|dict]

1.2.2.  AUTHENTICATE

   The AUTHENTICATE message is used with certain Authentication Methods.
   A *Client* having received a challenge is expected to respond by
   sending a signature or token.

       [AUTHENTICATE, Signature|string, Extra|dict]

1.2.3.  CANCEL

   The CANCEL message is used with the Call Canceling advanced feature.
   A _Caller_ can cancel an issued call actively by sending a cancel
   message to the _Dealer_.

       [CANCEL, CALL.Request|id, Options|dict]

1.2.4.  INTERRUPT

   The INTERRUPT message is used with the Call Canceling advanced
   feature.  Upon receiving a cancel for a pending call, a _Dealer_ will
   issue an interrupt to the _Callee_.

       [INTERRUPT, INVOCATION.Request|id, Options|dict]

2.  Meta API

2.1.  Session Meta API

   WAMP enables the monitoring of when sessions join a realm on the
   router or when they leave it via *Session Meta Events*. It also
   allows retrieving information about currently connected sessions via
   *Session Meta Procedures*.

   Meta events are created by the router itself.  This means that the
   events, as well as the data received when calling a meta procedure,
   can be accorded the same trust level as the router.

   |  Note that an implementation that only supports a _Broker_ or
   |  _Dealer_ role, not both at the same time, essentially cannot offer
   |  the *Session Meta API*, as it requires both roles to support this
   |  feature.

   The following sections contain an informal, easy to digest
   description of the WAMP procedures and topics available in (this part
   of) the WAMP Meta API.  A formal definition of the WAMP Meta API in
   terms of available WAMP procedures and topics including precise and

   procedure arguments and results or event payloads is contained in

   *  Compiled Binary Schema: <WAMP API Catalog>/schema/wamp-meta.bfbs
   *  FlatBuffers Schema Source: <WAMP API Catalog>/src/wamp-meta.fbs

   which uses FlatBuffers IDL to describe the API.  The method of using
   FlatBuffers IDL and type definitions to formally define WAMP
   procedures and topics is detailed in section WAMP IDL (#wamp-idl).

   *Feature Announcement*

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by *both* _Dealers_ and

   which cover the lifecycle of a registration:

   *  wamp.registration.on_create: Fired when a registration is created
      through a registration request for a URI which was previously
      without a registration.
   *  wamp.registration.on_register: Fired when a _Callee_ session is
      added to a registration.
   *  wamp.registration.on_unregister: Fired when a _Callee_ session is
      removed from a registration.
   *  wamp.registration.on_delete: Fired when a registration is deleted
      after the last _Callee_ session attached to it has been removed.

   A wamp.registration.on_register event MUST be fired subsequent to a
   wamp.registration.on_create event, since the first registration
   results in both the creation of the registration and the addition of
   a session.

   Similarly, the wamp.registration.on_delete event MUST be preceded by
   a wamp.registration.on_unregister event.

   *Registration Meta Events* MUST be dispatched by the router to the
   same realm as the WAMP session which triggered the event.

2.3.  Subscriptions Meta API

   Within an application, it may be desirable for a publisher to know
   whether a publication to a specific topic currently makes sense, i.e.
   whether there are any subscribers who would receive an event based on
   the publication.  It may also be desirable to keep a current count of
   subscribers to a topic to then be able to filter out any subscribers
   who are not supposed to receive an event.

   Subscription _meta-events_ are fired when topics are first created,
   when clients subscribe/unsubscribe to them, and when topics are
   deleted.  WAMP allows retrieving information about subscriptions via
   subscription _meta-procedures_.

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by Brokers via

       HELLO.Details.roles.broker.features.subscription_meta_api|
           bool := true

   Meta-events are created by the router itself.  This means that the
   events as well as the data received when calling a meta-procedure can
   be accorded the same trust level as the router.

   The following sections contain an informal, easy to digest
   description of the WAMP procedures and topics available in (this part
   of) the WAMP Meta API.  A formal definition of the WAMP Meta API in
   terms of available WAMP procedures and topics including precise and
   complete type definitions of the application payloads, that is
   procedure arguments and results or event payloads is contained in

   *  Compiled Binary Schema: <WAMP API Catalog>/schema/wamp-meta.bfbs
   *  FlatBuffers Schema Source: <WAMP API Catalog>/src/wamp-meta.fbs

   which uses FlatBuffers IDL to describe the API.  The method of using
   FlatBuffers IDL and type definitions to formally define WAMP
   procedures and topics is detailed in section WAMP IDL (#wamp-idl).

   *Feature Announcement*

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by a _Brokers_ (role :=

2.3.1.  Events

   A client can subscribe to the following session meta-events, which
   cover the lifecycle of a subscription:

   *  wamp.subscription.on_create: Fired when a subscription is created
      through a subscription request for a topic which was previously
      without subscribers.
   *  wamp.subscription.on_subscribe: Fired when a session is added to a
      subscription.

   *  wamp.subscription.on_unsubscribe: Fired when a session is removed
      from a subscription.
   *  wamp.subscription.on_delete: Fired when a subscription is deleted
      after the last session attached to it has been removed.

   A wamp.subscription.on_subscribe event MUST always be fired
   subsequent to a wamp.subscription.on_create event, since the first
   subscribe results in both the creation of the subscription and the
   addition of a session.  Similarly, the wamp.subscription.on_delete
   event MUST always be preceded by a wamp.subscription.on_unsubscribe
   event.

   The WAMP subscription meta events shall be dispatched by the router
   to the same realm as the WAMP session which triggered the event.

2.3.1.1.  wamp.subscription.on_create

   Fired when a subscription is created through a subscription request
   for a topic which was previously without subscribers.  The event
   payload consists of positional arguments:

3.  Advanced RPC

3.1.  Progressive Call Results

   A procedure implemented by a _Callee_ and registered at a _Dealer_
   may produce progressive results.  Progressive results can e.g. be
   used to return partial results for long-running operations, or to
   chunk the transmission of larger results sets.

   *Feature Announcement*

   Support for this advanced feature MUST be announced by _Callers_
   (role := "caller"), _Callees_ (role := "callee") and _Dealers_ (role
   := "dealer") via

       HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.
            progressive_call_results|bool := true

   Additionally, _Callees_ and _Dealers_ MUST support Call Canceling,
   which is required for canceling progressive results if the original
   _Caller_ leaves the realm.  If a _Callee_ supports Progressive Call
   Results, but not Call Canceling, then the _Dealer_ disregards the
   _Callees_ Progressive Call Results feature.

   Upon receiving an YIELD message from a _Callee_ with
   YIELD.Options.progress == true (for a call that is still ongoing),
   the _Dealer_ will *immediately* send a RESULT message to the original
   _Caller_ with

       RESULT.Details.progress|bool := true

   An invocation MUST _always_ end in either a _normal_ RESULT or ERROR
   message being sent by the _Callee_ and received by the _Dealer_.

   In other words: YIELD with YIELD.Options.progress == true and RESULT
   with RESULT.Details.progress == true messages may only be sent
   _during_ a call or invocation is still ongoing.

   The final YIELD and final RESULT may also be empty, e.g. when all
   actual results have already been transmitted in progressive result
   messages.

   Even if a _Caller_ has indicated its expectation to receive
   progressive results by setting CALL.Options.receive_progress|bool :=
   true, a _Callee_ is *not required* to produce progressive results.
   CALL.Options.receive_progress and INVOCATION.Details.receive_progress
   are simply indications that the _Caller_ is prepared to process
   progressive results, should there be any produced.  In other words,
   _Callees_ are free to ignore such receive_progress hints at any time.

   *Caller Leaving*

   The _Dealer_'s behavior for when a _Caller_ leaves or disconnects
   during a progressive results call shall be the same as in a basic,
   non-progressive call.  That is, the _Dealer_ sends an INTERRUPT to
   the _Callee_ with mode="killnowait".  See Caller Leaving During RPC
   Invocation (#rpc-caller-leaving) under the Basic Profile.

   Such cancellation when the caller leaves addresses a potential
   security vulnerability: In cases where progressive results are used
   to stream data to _Callers_, and network connectivity is unreliable,
   _Callers_ may often get disconnected in the middle of receiving such
   progressive results.  Without the mandated cancellation behavior,
   recurring connect-call-disconnect cycles by a _Caller_ would result
   in a rapidly growing backlog of unprocessed streaming results,
   overloading the router and further degrading network connectivity.

   *Callee Leaving*

   The _Dealer_'s behavior for when a _Callee_ leaves or disconnects
   during a progressive results call shall be the same as in a basic,
   non-progressive call.  That is, the _Dealer_ sends an ERROR message
   to the _Caller_ with the wamp.error.canceled URI.  See Callee Leaving
   During an RPC Invocation (#rpc-callee-leaving) under the Basic
   Profile.

   *Ignoring Requests for Progressive Call Results*

   A _Callee_ that does not support progressive results SHOULD ignore
   any INVOCATION.Details.receive_progress flag.

   A _Callee_ that supports progressive results, but does not support
   call canceling is considered by the _Dealer_ to not support
   progressive results.

   *Timeouts*

   When the _Call Timeouts_ feature is used in combination with
   Progressive Call Results, the CALL.Options.timeout|integer option
   shall represent the time limit between the initial call and the first
   result, and between results thereafter.

   For Dealer-initiated timeouts, this corresponds to - the time between
   receipt of the CALL message and receipt of the first YIELD message,
   and, - the time between received YIELD messages thereafter.

   For Callee-initiated timeouts, this corresponds to - the time between
   receipt of the INVOCATION message and acquisition of the first
   result, and, - the time between acquisition of successive results
   thereafter.

   Note that for progressive results, the timeout value does _not_
   correspond to the duration of the complete call from initiation to
   the final result.  The rationale for this is that it would be
   unfeasible to compute a reasonable timeout value for a call having a
   non-deterministic number of progressive results.

3.2.  Progressive Call Invocations

   A _Caller_ may issue a call having progressive invocations.  This can
   be useful in a few cases:

   *  Payload is too big to send it whole in one request, e.g.,
      uploading a file.
   *  Long-term data transfer that needs to be consumed early, such as a
      media stream.
   *  RPC is called too often and overall processing can be optimized:
      avoid the need to generate a new id for requests, initiate data
      structures for a new call, etc.

   In such cases, a procedure implemented by a _Callee_ and registered
   at a _Dealer_ may be made to receive progressive call invocations,
   where the _Callee_ may start processing the incoming data without
   awaiting the entire set of payload chunks.

   *Feature Announcement*

   Support for this advanced feature MUST be announced by _Callers_
   (role := "caller"), _Callees_ (role := "callee") and _Dealers_ (role
   := "dealer") via

    HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.progressive_call_invocations|bool := true

   Progressive call invocations can work only if all three peers support
   and announce this feature.  In addition, _Callees_ MUST announce
   support of the _Call Cancelling_ feature via

       HELLO.Details.roles.callee.features.call_cancelling|bool := true

   As a consequence, _Dealers_ MUST also announce support of the _Call
   Cancelling_ feature via

      WELCOME.Details.roles.dealer.features.call_cancelling|bool := true

   The following cases, where a _Caller_ sends a CALL message with
   progress := true, MUST be treated as _protocol errors_ with the
   underlying WAMP sessions being aborted:

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-AP                  September 2025


   *  The _Caller_ did not announce the progressive call invocations
      feature during the HELLO handshake.
   *  The _Dealer_ did not announce the progressive call invocations
      feature during the HELLO handshake.

   Otherwise, in cases where the _Caller_ sends a CALL message with
   progress := true but the _Callee_ does not support progressive call
   invocations or call cancelling, the call MUST be treated as an
   _application error_ with the _Dealer_ responding to the _Caller_ with
   the wamp.error.feature_not_supported error message.

   *Message Flow*

   The message flow for a progressive call when a _Callee_ waits for all
   chunks before processing and sending a single result:

    ,------.                  ,------.                 ,------.
    |Caller|                  |Dealer|                 |Callee|

       |                         |                        |

    `------'                  `------'                 `------'

   As a progressive call chunks are part of the same overall call, the
   _Caller_ must send the same Request|id for every CALL and the
   _Dealer_ must also use the same Request|id with every INVOCATION to
   the _Callee_.

   A _Caller_ indicates its willingness to issue a progressive call by
   setting

       CALL.Options.progress|bool := true

   _Example._ Caller-to-Dealer CALL

       [
           48,
           77245,
           {
               "progress": true
           },
           "com.myapp.get_country_by_coords",
           [50.450001, 30.523333]
       ]

   If the _Callee_ supports progressive call invocations, the _Dealer_
   shall forward the _Caller's_ willingness to send progressive call
   invocations by setting

       INVOCATION.Details.progress|bool := true

   _Example._ Dealer-to-Callee INVOCATION

       [
           68,
           35224,
           379,
           {
               "progress": true
           },
           [50.450001, 30.523333]
       ]

   A call invocation MUST _always_ end in a _normal_ CALL without the
   "progress": true option, or explicitly set "progress": false which is
   the default.

   *Progressive Call Invocations and Shared Registration*

   RPCs can have a multiple registrations (see Shared Registration
   feature) with different <invocation_policies>.  However, allowing
   progressive CALL messages to be routed to different _Callees_ would
   lead to unexpected results.  To prevent this the _Dealer_ MUST make a
   first INVOCATION based on <invocation_policy> and then route all
   subsequent progressive calls to the same _Callee_.

   As in progressive call results, such cancellation when the caller
   leaves addresses a potential security vulnerability: In cases where
   progressive call invocations are used to stream data from a _Caller_,
   and network connectivity is unreliable, the _Caller_ may often get
   disconnected in the middle of sending progressive data.  This can
   lead to unneeded memory consumption for the _Dealer_ and _Callee_,
   due to the need to store temporary metadata about ongoing calls.

   *Callee Leaving*

   The _Dealer_'s behavior for when a _Callee_ leaves or disconnects
   during a call with progressive invocations shall be the same as in a
   basic, non-progressive call.  That is, the _Dealer_ sends an ERROR
   message to the _Caller_ with the wamp.error.canceled URI.  See Callee
   Leaving During an RPC Invocation (#rpc-callee-leaving) under the
   Basic Profile.

   *Continuations on Completed Calls*

   A call with progressive invocations is considered completed by the
   _Dealer_ when the latter receives a correlated final YIELD or ERROR
   message from the _Callee_, or when the _Callee_ leaves the realm.

   Due to network delays, the _Caller_ may be unaware that the call is
   completed by time it sends another progressive CALL continuation.

   When a _Dealer_ receives a CALL under the following conditions:

   *  the _Dealer_ supports Progressive Call Invocations,
   *  the CALL request ID does not correspond to a new call request,
      and,
   *  the CALL request ID does not match any RPC invocation in progress,

   then it MUST ignore and discard that CALL message without any further
   correlated response to the _Caller_. The rationale for this is that
   the _Caller_ will eventually receive a correlated RESULT or ERROR
   message from the previous call completion and will be able to handle
   the call completion accordingly.

   The sequence diagram below illustrates this sitation, where the
   Network actor models network delay.

   *Verification of CALL Request IDs*

   When sending a CALL that continues a progressive call, its request ID
   is the same as the CALL that initiated the progressive call
   invocation.  Therefore, when progressive call invocations are
   enabled, request IDs from CALL messages may not appear sequential.
   For example:

   1.  [CALL, 1, {"progress":true}, "foo"]



Oberstein                 Expires 28 March 2026                [Page 44]

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-AP                  September 2025


   2.  [CALL, 2, {}, "bar"]
   3.  [CALL, 1, {}, "foo"] (OK, continues CALL request #1)

   The requirement for CALL request IDs to be sequential session scope
   (see Protocol Violations (#protocol_errors)) must therefore only
   apply to *new* RPC transactions:

   1.  [CALL, 1, {"progress":true}, "foo"]
   2.  [CALL, 2, {}, "bar"]
   3.  [CALL, 4, {}, "baz"] (protocol violation, request ID 3 expected)

   Let us define _watermark_ as the maximum valid request ID of all
   received CALL messages during a _Dealer_'s run time.

   Let us also define _continuation candiate_ as a CALL with a request
   ID that is equal to or less than the _watermark_.

   When a _Dealer_ receives a CALL with a request ID that is exactly one
   above the watermark, then it shall be considered a new RPC
   transaction, and the requirement for sequential session scope IDs is
   verified.

   When a _Dealer_ receives a CALL with a request ID that is greater
   than one above the watermark, then this corresponds to a gap in the
   session scope ID sequence and MUST always be treated as a protocol
   violation.

   When a _Dealer_ receives a CALL with a request ID that is equal to or
   less than the watermark, then it is considered as a _continuation
   candidate_ for a progressive invocation transfer.

   As discussed in the previous section, a _Caller_ may be unaware that
   a progressive invocation transfer is completed while sending a CALL
   continuation for that progressive invocation.  Therefore, the
   _Dealer_ cannot simply just check against progressive transfers in
   progress when verifying the validity of continuation candidates.  It
   must also consider past progressive transfers that have been
   completed.

   In order to validate the request ID of continuation candidates, it is
   suggested that a _Dealer_ maintain a table of request IDs of
   completed progressive invocation transfers, where each entry is kept
   for a limited _grace period_. When a _Dealer_ receives a continuation
   candidate with a request ID that is not in that table, nor in the
   list of active progressive invocations, then it is considered a
   protocol violation.  Care must be taken in choosing the grace period:
   too short and data races can occur with slow networks, too long and
   memory usage of the table may become excessive when frequent
   progressive calls are made.

   Due to resource constraints, it may not be desireable to implement
   such a grace period table, so _Dealers_ MAY instead discard
   continuation candidates with request IDs that cannot be found in the
   list of active progressive invocation transfers.

   The following pseudocode summarizes the algorithm for verifying CALL
   request IDs when progressive call invocations are enabled:

   if (request_id == watermark + 1)
       watermark = watermak + 1
       initiate_new_call()
   else if (request_id > watermark + 1)
       // Gap in request IDs
       abort_session("wamp.error.protocol_violation")
   else
       // Continuation candidate
       if (active_call_records.contains(request_id, procedure_uri))
           record = active_call_records.at(request_id)
           if (record.is_progressive_invocation_call())
               continue_call()
           else
               abort_session("wamp.error.protocol_violation")
           endif
       else if (strict_request_id_verification_enabled)
           if (grace_period_table.contains(request_id, procedure_uri))
               discard_call()
           else
               abort_session("wamp.error.protocol_violation")
           endif
       else
           discard_call()
       endif
   endif

   *Ignoring Progressive Call Invocations*

   Unlike some other advanced features, a _Callee_ cannot be unaware of
   progressive call invocations.  Therefore, if a _Callee_ doesn't
   support this feature, the _Dealer_ MUST respond to the _Caller_ with
   an wamp.error.feature_not_supported error message.

   A _Callee_ that supports progressive call invocations, but does not
   support call canceling, shall be considered by the _Dealer_ as not
   supporting progressive call invocations.

   *Progressive Call Invocations with Progressive Call Results*

   _Progressive Call Invocations_ may be used in conjunction with
   _Progressive Call Results_ if the _Caller_, _Dealer_, and _Callee_
   all support both features.  This allows the _Callee_ to start sending
   partial results back to the _Caller_ after receiving one or more
   initial payload chunks.  Efficient two-way streams between a _Caller_
   and _Callee_ can be implemented this way.

   The following message flow illustrates a call using progressive call
   invocations when a _Callee_ starts sending progressive call results
   immediately.  Note that YIELD messages don't need to be matched with
   CALL/INVOCATION messages.  For example, the _caller_ can send a few
   CALL messages before starting to receive RESULT messages; they do not
   need to be matched pairs.

   Because they are part of the same call operation, the request ID is
   the same in all CALL, INVOCATION, YIELD, and ERROR messages in the
   above exchange.

   *Freezing of Options in Progressive Call Invocations*

   Except for progress, items in the Options dictionary of the
   *initiating* progressive CALL shall be effective for the entirety of
   the progressive call request.  Only the progress option shall be
   considered by the _Dealer_ in subsequent progressive call invocations
   (within the same overall request).  Except for progress, items in the
   Details dictionary of corresponding INVOCATION messages shall be
   based on the initiating progressive CALL only.

   For example, if disclose_me=true was specified in the initiating
   progressive call, all subsequent progressive call invocations (within
   the same call) shall be considered by the _Dealer_ to implictly have
   disclose_me=true as well.  That is, all INVOCATION messages
   associated with the overall request shall contain caller identify
   information.

   Any option besides progress SHOULD be omitted altogether by the
   _Caller_ in subsequent progressive call invocations.  Not having to
   repeat (and not being able to change) options is more in tune with
   the concept of a media stream where options are set up initially, and
   the source (_Caller_) only needs to keep uploading more data
   thereafter.

   In subsequent call invocations:

   *  _Dealers_ and _Callees_ MUST ignore any option except for progress
   *  _Dealers_ SHOULD NOT propagate any option passed by the _Caller_,
      except for progress

   _Dealers_ and _Callees_ are responsible for remembering the options
   of the initiating progressive CALL.

   For reference, here is a list of options that are frozen upon the
   initial progressive call invocations:

   *  CALL.Options.disclose_me|bool
   *  CALL.Options.ppt_cipher|string
   *  CALL.Options.ppt_keyid|string
   *  CALL.Options.ppt_scheme|string
   *  CALL.Options.ppt_serializer|string
   *  CALL.Options.receive_progress|bool
   *  CALL.Options.rkey
   *  CALL.Options.runmode|string
   *  CALL.Options.timeout|integer

   These rules concerning progressive call invocation options also apply
   to custom options that are not part of this specification.

3.3.  Call Timeouts

   The Call Timeouts feature allows for *automatic* cancellation of a
   remote procedure call by the _Dealer_ or _Callee_ after a specified
   time duration.

   A _Caller_ specifies a timeout by providing

       CALL.Options.timeout|integer

   in milliseconds.  Automatic call timeouts are deactivated if there is
   no timeout option, or if its value is 0.

   *Dealer-Initiated Timeouts*

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-AP                  September 2025


   If the _Callee_ does not support Call Timeouts, a _Dealer_ supporting
   this feature MUST start a timeout timer upon receiving a CALL message
   with a timeout option.  The message flow for call timeouts is
   identical to Call Canceling, except that there is no CANCEL message
   that originates from the _Caller_. The cancellation mode is
   implicitly killnowait if the _Callee_ supports call cancellation,
   otherwise the cancellation mode is skip.

   The error message that is returned to the _Caller_ MUST use
   wamp.error.timeout as the reason URI.

   *Callee-Initiated Timeouts*

   If the _Callee_ supports Call Timeouts, the _Dealer_ MAY propagate
   the CALL.Options.timeout|integer option via the INVOCATION message
   and allow the _Callee_ to handle the timeout logic.  If the operation
   times out, the _Callee_ MUST return an ERROR message with
   wamp.error.timeout as the reason URI.

   _Callees_ wanting to handle the timeout logic MAY specify this
   intention via the REGISTER.Options.forward_timeout|boolean option.
   The _Dealer_, upon receiving a CALL with the timeout option set,
   checks if the matching RPC registration had the forward_timeout
   option set, then accordingly either forwards the timeout value or
   handles the timeout logic locally without forwarding the timeout
   value.

   _Dealers_ MAY choose to override the
   REGISTER.Options.forward_timeout|boolean option based on router
   configuration.  For example, if a _Dealer_ is resource-constrained
   and does not wish to maintain a queue of pending call timeouts, it
   may decide to always forward the CALL timeout option to _Callees_.

   *Caller-Initiated Timeouts*

   _Callers_ may run their own timeout timer and send a CANCEL message
   upon timeout.  This is permitted if the _Dealer_ supports Call
   Canceling and is not considered to be a usage of the Call Timeouts
   feature.

   *Feature Announcement*

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Dealers_ (role :=
   "dealer") and MAY be announced by _Callees_ (role := "callee") via

       HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.call_timeout|bool := true

   If a _Callee_ does not support Call Timeouts, it may optionally
   announce support for Call Cancellation via

       HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.call_canceling|bool := true

3.4.  Call Canceling

   A _Caller_ might want to actively cancel a call that was issued, but
   not has yet returned.  An example where this is useful could be a
   user triggering a long running operation and later changing his mind
   or no longer willing to wait.

   *Feature Announcement*

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Callers_ (role :=
   "caller"), _Callees_ (role := "callee") and _Dealers_ (role :=
   "dealer") via

       HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.call_canceling|bool := true

   *Message Flow*

   The message flow between _Callers_, a _Dealer_ and _Callees_ for
   canceling remote procedure calls involves the following messages:

   *  CANCEL
   *  INTERRUPT
   *  ERROR

   A call may be canceled at the _Callee_ or at the _Dealer_ side.
   Cancellation behaves differently depending on the mode:

   *  *skip*: The pending call is canceled and ERROR is sent immediately
      back to the caller.  No INTERRUPT is sent to the callee and the
      result is discarded when received.
   *  *kill*: INTERRUPT is sent to the callee, but ERROR is not returned
      to the caller until after the callee has responded to the canceled
      call.  In this case the caller may receive RESULT or ERROR
      depending whether the callee finishes processing the invocation or
      the interrupt first.
   *  *killnowait*: The pending call is canceled and ERROR is sent
      immediately back to the caller.  INTERRUPT is sent to the callee
      and any response to the invocation or interrupt from the callee is
      discarded when received.

   If the callee does not support call canceling, then behavior is
   *skip*.

   A _Caller_ cancels a remote procedure call initiated (but not yet
   finished) by sending a CANCEL message to the _Dealer_:

       [CANCEL, CALL.Request|id, Options|dict]

   A _Dealer_ cancels an invocation of an endpoint initiated (but not
   yet finished) by sending a INTERRUPT message to the _Callee_:

       [INTERRUPT, INVOCATION.Request|id, Options|dict]

   Options:

       CANCEL.Options.mode|string == "skip" | "kill" | "killnowait"

   *Ignoring Results after Cancel*

   After the _Dealer_ sends an INTERRUPT when mode="killnowait", any
   responses from the _Callee_ are ignored.  This means that it is not
   necessary for the _Callee_ to respond with an ERROR message, when
   mode="killnowait", since the _Dealer_ ignores it.

3.5.  Call Re-Routing

   A _CALLEE_ might not be able to attend to a call.  This may be due to
   a multitude of reasons including, but not limited to:

   *  _CALLEE_ is busy handling other requests and is not able to attend
   *  _CALLEE_ has dependency issues which prevent it from being able to
      fulfil the request
   *  In a HA environment, the _Callee_ knows that it is scheduled to be
      taken off the HA cluster and as such should not handle the
      request.

   A _unavailable_ response allows for *automatic* reroute of a call by
   the _Dealer_ without the _CALLER_ ever having to know about it.

   When such a situation occurs, the _Callee_ responds to a INVOCATION
   message with the error uri:

   wamp.error.unavailable

   When the _Dealer_ receives the wamp.error.unavailable message in
   response to an INVOCATION, it will reroute the CALL to another
   _registration_ according to the rerouting rules of the
   invocation_policy of the procedure, as given below.

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Callees_ (role :=
   "callee") and _Dealers_ (role := "dealer") via

   HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.call_reroute|bool := true

   *Rerouting Rules*

   The _Dealer_ MUST adhere to the invocation policy of the procedure
   when rerouting the CALL, while assuming that the unavailable
   registration virtually does not exist.

   For different invocation policy the _Dealer_ MUST follow:

      +============+================================================+
      | Invocation | Operation                                      |
      | Policy     |                                                |
      +============+================================================+

      |            | error message to the _CALLER_                  |
      +------------+------------------------------------------------+
      | roundrobin | Picks the next registration from the           |
      |            | _Registration Queue_ of the _Procedure_        |
      +------------+------------------------------------------------+
      | random     | Picks another registration at random from the  |
      |            | Registration Queue of the _Procedure_, as long |
      |            | as it is not the same registration             |
      +------------+------------------------------------------------+
      | first      | Picks the registration which was registered    |
      |            | after the _called_ registration was registered |
      +------------+------------------------------------------------+
      | last       | Picks the registration which was registered    |
      |            | right before the _called_ registration was     |
      |            | registered                                     |
      +------------+------------------------------------------------+

                                  Table 6

   *Failure Scenario*

   In case all available registrations of a _Procedure_ responds with a
   wamp.error.unavailable for a _CALL_, the _Dealer_ MUST respond with a
   wamp.error.no_available_callee to the _CALLER_

3.6.  Caller Identification

   A _Caller_ MAY *request* the disclosure of its identity (its WAMP
   session ID) to endpoints of a routed call via

       [48, 7814135, {"disclose_me": true}, "com.myapp.echo",
           ["Hello, world!"]]

   If above call is issued by a _Caller_ with WAMP session ID 3335656,
   the _Dealer_ sends an INVOCATION message to _Callee_ with the
   _Caller's_ WAMP session ID in INVOCATION.Details.caller:

   _Example_

       [68, 6131533, 9823526, {"caller": 3335656}, ["Hello, world!"]]

   Note that a _Dealer_ MAY disclose the identity of a _Caller_ even
   without the _Caller_ having explicitly requested to do so when the
   _Dealer_ configuration (for the called procedure) is setup to do so.

   *Identity Information*

   When _Caller_ disclosure is allowed for a particular CALL message,
   the corresponding INVOCATION message MUST contain an
   INVOCATION.Details.caller|integer property set to the _Caller_'s
   session ID.

   The following additional properties MAY also be included::

   *  INVOCATION.Details.caller_authid|string
   *  INVOCATION.Details.caller_authrole|string

   *Feature Announcement*

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Callers_ (role :=
   "caller"), _Callees_ (role := "callee") and _Dealers_ (role :=
   "dealer") via

       HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.
            caller_identification|bool := true

   *Request Identification*

   A _Dealer_ MAY deny a _Caller's_ request to disclose its identity:

   _Example_

       [8, 48, 7814135, "wamp.error.disclose_me.not_allowed"]

   A _Callee_ MAY *request* the disclosure of caller identity via

       REGISTER.Options.disclose_caller|bool := true

   _Example_

       [64, 927639114088448, {"disclose_caller":true},
           "com.maypp.add2"]

   With the above registration, the registered procedure is called with
   the caller's sessionID as part of the call details object.

3.7.  Call Trust Levels

   A _Dealer_ may be configured to automatically assign _trust levels_
   to calls issued by _Callers_ according to the _Dealer_ configuration
   on a per-procedure basis and/or depending on the application defined
   role of the (authenticated) _Caller_.

   A _Dealer_ supporting trust level will provide

       INVOCATION.Details.trustlevel|integer

   in an INVOCATION message sent to a _Callee_. The trustlevel 0 means
   lowest trust, and higher integers represent (application-defined)
   higher levels of trust.

   _Example_

       [68, 6131533, 9823526, {"trustlevel": 2}, ["Hello, world!"]]

   In above event, the _Dealer_ has (by configuration and/or other
   information) deemed the call (and hence the invocation) to be of
   trustlevel 2.

   *Feature Announcement*

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Callees_ (role :=
   "callee") and _Dealers_ (role := "dealer") via

       HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.call_trustlevels|bool := true

3.8.  Pattern-based Registrations

   By default, _Callees_ register procedures with *exact matching
   policy*. That is a call will only be routed to a _Callee_ by the
   _Dealer_ if the procedure called (CALL.Procedure) _exactly_ matches
   the endpoint registered (REGISTER.Procedure).

   A _Callee_ might want to register procedures based on a _pattern_.
   This can be useful to reduce the number of individual registrations
   to be set up or to subscribe to a open set of topics, not known
   beforehand by the _Subscriber_.

   If the _Dealer_ and the _Callee_ support *pattern-based
   registrations*, this matching can happen by

   *  *prefix-matching policy*
   *  *wildcard-matching policy*

   *Feature Announcement*

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Callees_ (role :=
   "callee") and _Dealers_ (role := "dealer") via

       HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.
           pattern_based_registration|bool := true

3.8.1.  Prefix Matching

   A _Callee_ requests *prefix-matching policy* with a registration
   request by setting

       REGISTER.Options.match|string := "prefix"

   _Example_

       [
           64,
           612352435,
           {
               "match": "prefix"
           },
           "com.myapp.myobject1"
       ]

   When a *prefix-matching policy* is in place, any call with a
   procedure that has REGISTER.Procedure as a _prefix_ will match the
   registration, and potentially be routed to _Callees_ on that
   registration.

   In above example, the following calls with CALL.Procedure

   *  com.myapp.myobject1.myprocedure1
   *  com.myapp.myobject1-mysubobject1
   *  com.myapp.myobject1.mysubobject1.myprocedure1
   *  com.myapp.myobject1

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-AP                  September 2025


   will all apply for call routing.  A call with one of the following
   CALL.Procedure

   *  com.myapp.myobject2
   *  com.myapp.myobject

   will not apply.

3.8.2.  Wildcard Matching

   A _Callee_ requests *wildcard-matching policy* with a registration
   request by setting

       REGISTER.Options.match|string := "wildcard"

   Wildcard-matching allows to provide wildcards for *whole* URI
   components.

   _Example_

       [
           64,
           612352435,
           {
               "match": "wildcard"
           },
           "com.myapp..myprocedure1"
       ]

   In the above registration request, the 3rd URI component is empty,
   which signals a wildcard in that URI component position.  In this
   example, calls with CALL.Procedure e.g.

   *  com.myapp.myobject1.myprocedure1
   *  com.myapp.myobject2.myprocedure1

   will all apply for call routing.  Calls with CALL.Procedure e.g.

   *  com.myapp.myobject1.myprocedure1.mysubprocedure1
   *  com.myapp.myobject1.myprocedure2
   *  com.myapp2.myobject1.myprocedure1

   will not apply for call routing.

   When a single call matches more than one of a _Callees_
   registrations, the call MAY be routed for invocation on multiple
   registrations, depending on call settings.

3.8.3.  Design Aspects

   *No set semantics*

   Since each _Callee_'s' registrations "stands on its own", there is no
   _set semantics_ implied by pattern-based registrations.

   E.g. a _Callee_ cannot register to a broad pattern, and then
   unregister from a subset of that broad pattern to form a more complex
   registration.  Each registration is separate.

   *Calls matching multiple registrations*

   There can be situations, when some call URI matches more then one
   registration.  In this case a call is routed to one and only one best
   matched RPC registration, or fails with ERROR
   wamp.error.no_such_procedure.

   The following algorithm MUST be applied to find a single RPC
   registration to which a call is routed:

   1.  Check for exact matching registration.  If this match exists —
       (U+2014) use it.
   2.  If there are prefix-based registrations, find the registration
       with the longest prefix match.  Longest means it has more URI
       components matched, e.g. for call URI a1.b2.c3.d4 registration
       a1.b2.c3 has higher priority than registration a1.b2.  If this
       match exists — (U+2014) use it.
   3.  If there are wildcard-based registrations, find the registration
       with the longest portion of URI components matched before each
       wildcard.  E.g. for call URI a1.b2.c3.d4 registration a1.b2..d4
       has higher priority than registration a1...d4, see below for more
       complex examples.  If this match exists — (U+2014) use it.
   4.  If there is no exact match, no prefix match, and no wildcard
       match, then _Dealer_ MUST return ERROR
       wamp.error.no_such_procedure.

   Registered RPCs:
       1. 'a1.b2.c3.d4.e55' (exact),
       2. 'a1.b2.c3' (prefix),
       3. 'a1.b2.c3.d4' (prefix),
       4. 'a1.b2..d4.e5',
       5. 'a1.b2.c33..e5',
       6. 'a1.b2..d4.e5..g7',
       7. 'a1.b2..d4..f6.g7'

   Call request RPC URI: 'a1.b2.c3.d4.e55' →
       exact match. Use RPC 1
   Call request RPC URI: 'a1.b2.c3.d98.e74' →
       no exact match, single prefix match. Use RPC 2
   Call request RPC URI: 'a1.b2.c3.d4.e325' →
       no exact match, 2 prefix matches (2,3), select longest one.
       Use RPC 3
   Call request RPC URI: 'a1.b2.c55.d4.e5' →
       no exact match, no prefix match, single wildcard match.
       Use RPC 4
   Call request RPC URI: 'a1.b2.c33.d4.e5' →
       no exact match, no prefix match, 2 wildcard matches (4,5),
       but RPC 5 has longer first portion (a1.b2.c33). Use RPC 5
   Call request RPC URI: 'a1.b2.c88.d4.e5.f6.g7' →
       no exact match, no prefix match, 2 wildcard matches (6,7),
       both having equal first portions (a1.b2), but RPC 6 has longer
       second portion (d4.e5). Use RPC 6
   Call request RPC URI: 'a2.b2.c2.d2.e2' →
       no exact match, no prefix match, no wildcard match.
       Return wamp.error.no_such_procedure

   *Concrete procedure called*

   If an endpoint was registered with a pattern-based matching policy, a
   _Dealer_ MUST supply the original CALL.Procedure as provided by the
   _Caller_ in

       INVOCATION.Details.procedure

   to the _Callee_.

           ["Hello, world!"]
       ]

3.9.  Shared Registration

   Feature status: *alpha*

   As a default, only a single *Callee* may register a procedure for a
   URI.

   There are use cases where more flexibility is required.  As an
   example, for an application component with a high computing load,
   several instances may run, and load balancing of calls across these
   may be desired.  As another example, in an application a second or
   third component providing a procedure may run, which are only to be
   called in case the primary component is no longer reachable (hot
   standby).

   When shared registrations are supported, then the first *Callee* to
   register a procedure for a particular URI MAY determine that
   additional registrations for this URI are allowed, and what
   *Invocation Rules* to apply in case such additional registrations are
   made.

   This is done through setting

       REGISTER.Options.invoke|string := <invocation_policy>

   where <invocation_policy> is one of

   *  'single'
   *  'roundrobin'
   *  'random'
   *  'first'
   *  'last'

   If the option is not set, 'single' is applied as a default.

   With 'single', the *Dealer* MUST fail all subsequent attempts to
   register a procedure for the URI while the registration remains in
   existence.

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-AP                  September 2025


   With the other values, the *Dealer* MUST fail all subsequent attempts
   to register a procedure for the URI where the value for this option
   does not match that of the initial registration.

   *Feature Announcement*

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Callees_ (role :=
   "callee") and _Dealers_ (role := "dealer") via

       HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.
           shared_registration|bool := true

3.9.1.  Load Balancing

   For sets of registrations registered using either 'roundrobin' or
   'random', load balancing is performed across calls to the URI.

   For 'roundrobin', callees are picked subsequently from the list of
   registrations (ordered by the order of registration), with the
   picking looping back to the beginning of the list once the end has
   been reached.

   For 'random' a callee is picked randomly from the list of
   registrations for each call.

3.9.2.  Hot Stand-By

   For sets of registrations registered using either 'first' or 'last',
   the first respectively last callee on the current list of
   registrations (ordered by the order of registration) is called.

3.10.  Sharded Registration

   Feature status: *sketch*

   *Sharded Registrations* are intended to allow calling a procedure
   which is offered by a sharded database, by routing the call to a
   single shard.

   *Feature Announcement*

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Callers_ (role :=
   "caller"), _Callees_ (role := "callee") and _Dealers_ (role :=
   "dealer") via

   HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.sharded_registration|bool := true

3.10.1.  "All" Calls

   Write me.

3.10.2.  "Partitioned" Calls

   If CALL.Options.runmode == "partition", then CALL.Options.rkey MUST
   be present.

   The call is then routed to all endpoints that were registered ..

   The call is then processed as for "All" Calls.

3.11.  Registration Revocation

   Feature status: *alpha*

   This feature allows a _Dealer_ to actively revoke a previously
   granted registration.  To achieve this, the existing UNREGISTERED
   message is extended as described below.

   *Feature Announcement*

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Callees_ (role :=
   "callee") and _Dealers_ (role := "dealer") via

       HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.
            registration_revocation|bool := true

   If the _Callee_ does not support registration_revocation, the
   _Dealer_ may still revoke a registration to support administrative
   functionality.  In this case, the _Dealer_ MUST NOT send an
   *UNREGISTERED* message to the _Callee_. The _Callee_ MAY use the
   registration meta event wamp.registration.on_unregister to determine
   whether a session is removed from a registration.

   *Extending UNREGISTERED*

   When revoking a registration, the router has no request ID to reply
   to.  So it's set to zero and another argument is appended to indicate
   which registration to revoke.  Optionally, a reason why the
   registration was revoked is also appended.

       [UNREGISTERED, 0, Details|dict]

      ID.
   *  Details.reason|string MAY provide a reason as to why the
      registration was revoked.

    [67, 0, {"registration": 1293722, "reason": "moving endpoint to other callee"}]

4.  Advanced PubSub

4.1.  Subscriber Black- and Whitelisting

   *Subscriber Black- and Whitelisting* is an advanced _Broker_ feature
   where a _Publisher_ is able to restrict the set of receivers of a
   published event.

   Under normal Publish & Subscriber event dispatching, a _Broker_ will
   dispatch a published event to all (authorized) _Subscribers_ other
   than the _Publisher_ itself.  This set of receivers can be further
   reduced on a per-publication basis by the _Publisher_ using
   *Subscriber Black- and Whitelisting*.

   The _Publisher_ can explicitly *exclude* _Subscribers_ based on WAMP
   sessionid, authid or authrole.  This is referred to as
   *Blacklisting*.

   A _Publisher_ may also explicitly define a *eligible* list of
   _Subscribers_ based on WAMP sessionid, authid or authrole.  This is
   referred to as *Whitelisting*.

   Use Cases include the following.

   *Avoiding Callers from being self-notified*

   Consider an application that exposes a procedure to update a product
   price.  The procedure might not only actually update the product
   price (e.g. in a backend database), but additionally publish an event
   with the updated product price, so that *all* application components
   get notified actively of the new price.

   However, the application might want to exclude the originator of the
   product price update (the *Caller* of the price update procedure)
   from receiving the update event - as the originator naturally already
   knows the new price, and might get confused when it receives an
   update the *Caller* has triggered himself.

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-AP                  September 2025


   The product price update procedure can use
   PUBLISH.Options.exclude|list[int] to exclude the *Caller* of the
   procedure.

   |  Note that the product price update procedure needs to know the
   |  session ID of the *Caller* to be able to exclude him.  For this,
   |  please see *Caller Identification*.

   A similar approach can be used for other CRUD-like procedures.

   *Restricting receivers of sensitive information*

   Consider an application with users that have different authroles,
   such as "manager" and "staff" that publishes events with updates to
   "customers".  The topics being published to could be structured like

       com.example.myapp.customer.<customer ID>

   The application might want to restrict the receivers of customer
   updates depending on the authrole of the user.  E.g. a user
   authenticated under authrole "manager" might be allowed to receive
   any kind of customer update, including personal and business
   sensitive information.  A user under authrole "staff" might only be
   allowed to receive a subset of events.

   The application can publish *all* customer updates to the *same*
   topic com.example.myapp.customer.<customer ID> and use
   PUBLISH.Options.eligible_authrole|list[string] to safely restrict the
   set of actual receivers as desired.

   *Feature Definition*

   A _Publisher_ may restrict the actual receivers of an event from the
   set of _Subscribers_ through the use of

   *  Blacklisting Options
      -  PUBLISH.Options.exclude|list[int]
      -  PUBLISH.Options.exclude_authid|list[string]
      -  PUBLISH.Options.exclude_authrole|list[string]
   *  Whitelisting Options
      -  PUBLISH.Options.eligible|list[int]
      -  PUBLISH.Options.eligible_authid|list[string]
      -  PUBLISH.Options.eligible_authrole|list[string]

   PUBLISH.Options.exclude is a list of integers with WAMP sessionids
   providing an explicit list of (potential) _Subscribers_ that won't
   receive a published event, even though they may be subscribed.  In
   other words, PUBLISH.Options.exclude is a *blacklist* of (potential)
   _Subscribers_.

   PUBLISH.Options.eligible is a list of integers with WAMP WAMP
   sessionids providing an explicit list of (potential) _Subscribers_
   that are allowed to receive a published event.  In other words,
   PUBLISH.Options.eligible is a *whitelist* of (potential)
   _Subscribers_.

   The exclude_authid, exclude_authrole, eligible_authid and
   eligible_authrole options work similar, but not on the basis of WAMP
   sessionid, but authid and authrole.

   An (authorized) _Subscriber_ to topic T will receive an event
   published to T if and only if all of the following statements hold
   true:

   1.  if there is an eligible attribute present, the _Subscriber_'s
       sessionid is in this list
   2.  if there is an eligible_authid attribute present, the
       _Subscriber_'s authid is in this list
   3.  if there is an eligible_authrole attribute present, the
       _Subscriber_'s authrole is in this list
   4.  if there is an exclude attribute present, the _Subscriber_'s
       sessionid is NOT in this list
   5.  if there is an exclude_authid attribute present, the
       _Subscriber_'s authid is NOT in this list
   6.  if there is an exclude_authrole attribute present, the
       _Subscriber_'s authrole is NOT in this list

   For example, if both PUBLISH.Options.exclude and
   PUBLISH.Options.eligible are present, the _Broker_ will dispatch
   events published only to _Subscribers_ that are not explicitly
   excluded in PUBLISH.Options.exclude *and* which are explicitly
   eligible via PUBLISH.Options.eligible.

   *Feature Announcement*

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Publishers_ (role :=
   "publisher") and _Brokers_ (role := "broker") via

       HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.
           subscriber_blackwhite_listing|bool := true

4.2.  Publisher Exclusion

   By default, a _Publisher_ of an event will *not* itself receive an
   event published, even when subscribed to the Topic the _Publisher_ is
   publishing to.  This behavior can be overridden using this feature.

   To override the exclusion of a publisher from its own publication,
   the PUBLISH message must include the following option:

       PUBLISH.Options.exclude_me|bool

   When publishing with PUBLISH.Options.exclude_me := false, the
   _Publisher_ of the event will receive that event, if it is subscribed
   to the Topic published to.

           },
           "com.myapp.mytopic1",
           ["Hello, world!"]
       ]

   In this example, the _Publisher_ will receive the published event, if
   it is subscribed to com.myapp.mytopic1.

   *Feature Announcement*

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Publishers_ (role :=
   "publisher") and _Brokers_ (role := "broker") via

       HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.
           publisher_exclusion|bool := true

4.3.  Publisher Identification

   A _Publisher_ may request the disclosure of its identity (its WAMP
   session ID) to receivers of a published event by setting

       PUBLISH.Options.disclose_me|bool := true

   _Example_

       [16, 239714735, {"disclose_me": true}, "com.myapp.mytopic1",
           ["Hello, world!"]]

   If above event is published by a _Publisher_ with WAMP session ID
   3335656, the _Broker_ would send an EVENT message to _Subscribers_
   with the _Publisher's_ WAMP session ID in EVENT.Details.publisher:

   _Example_

       [36, 5512315355, 4429313566, {"publisher": 3335656},
           ["Hello, world!"]]

   Note that a _Broker_ may deny a _Publisher's_ request to disclose its
   identity:

   _Example_

      [8, 16, 239714735, {}, "wamp.error.option_disallowed.disclose_me"]

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-AP                  September 2025


   A _Broker_ may also (automatically) disclose the identity of a
   _Publisher_ even without the _Publisher_ having explicitly requested
   to do so when the _Broker_ configuration (for the publication topic)
   is set up to do so.

   *Additional Identity Information*

   When publisher disclosure is allowed for a particular PUBLISH
   message, the corresponding EVENT message MAY also contain the
   following additional properties in its Details dictionary:

   *  EVENT.Details.publisher_authid|string
   *  EVENT.Details.publisher_authrole|string

   *Feature Announcement*

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Publishers_ (role :=
   "publisher"), _Brokers_ (role := "broker") and _Subscribers_ (role :=
   "subscriber") via

       HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.
           publisher_identification|bool := true

4.4.  Publication Trust Levels

   A _Broker_ may be configured to automatically assign _trust levels_
   to events published by _Publishers_ according to the _Broker_
   configuration on a per-topic basis and/or depending on the
   application defined role of the (authenticated) _Publisher_.

   A _Broker_ supporting trust level will provide

       EVENT.Details.trustlevel|integer

   in an EVENT message sent to a _Subscriber_. The trustlevel 0 means
   lowest trust, and higher integers represent (application-defined)
   higher levels of trust.

   _Example_

       [36, 5512315355, 4429313566, {"trustlevel": 2},
           ["Hello, world!"]]

   In above event, the _Broker_ has (by configuration and/or other
   information) deemed the event publication to be of trustlevel 2.

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Subscribers_ (role :=
   "subscriber") and _Brokers_ (role := "broker") via

       HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.
           publication_trustlevels|bool := true

4.5.  Pattern-based Subscription

   By default, _Subscribers_ subscribe to topics with *exact matching
   policy*. That is an event will only be dispatched to a _Subscriber_
   by the _Broker_ if the topic published to (PUBLISH.Topic) _exactly_
   matches the topic subscribed to (SUBSCRIBE.Topic).

   A _Subscriber_ might want to subscribe to topics based on a
   _pattern_. This can be useful to reduce the number of individual
   subscriptions to be set up and to subscribe to topics the
   _Subscriber_ is not aware of at the time of subscription, or which do
   not yet exist at this time.

   Let's review the event publication flow.  When one peer decides to
   publish a message to a topic, it results in a PUBLISH WAMP message
   with fields for the Publication id, Details dictionary, and,
   optionally, the payload arguments.

   A given event received by the router from a publisher via a PUBLISH
   message will match one or more subscriptions:

   *  zero or one exact subscription
   *  zero or more prefix subscriptions
   *  zero or more wildcard subscriptions

   The same published event is then forwarded to subscribers for every
   matching subscription.  Thus, a given event might be sent multiple
   times to the same client under different subscriptions.  Every
   subscription instance, based on a topic URI and some options, has a
   unique ID.  All subscribers of the same subscription are given the
   same subscription ID.

   If the _Broker_ and the _Subscriber_ support *pattern-based
   subscriptions*, this matching can happen by

   *  prefix-matching policy
   *  wildcard-matching policy

   *Feature Announcement*

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Subscribers_ (role :=
   "subscriber") and _Brokers_ (role := "broker") via

       HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.
           pattern_based_subscription|bool := true

4.5.1.  Prefix Matching

   A _Subscriber_ requests *prefix-matching policy* with a subscription
   request by setting

       SUBSCRIBE.Options.match|string := "prefix"

   _Example_

       [
           32,
           912873614,
           {
               "match": "prefix"
           },
           "com.myapp.topic.emergency"
       ]

   When a *prefix-matching policy* is in place, any event with a topic
   that has SUBSCRIBE.Topic as a _prefix_ will match the subscription,
   and potentially be delivered to _Subscribers_ on the subscription.

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-AP                  September 2025


   In the above example, events with PUBLISH.Topic

   *  com.myapp.topic.emergency.11
   *  com.myapp.topic.emergency-low
   *  com.myapp.topic.emergency.category.severe
   *  com.myapp.topic.emergency

   will all apply for dispatching.  An event with PUBLISH.Topic e.g.
   com.myapp.topic.emerge will not apply.

4.5.2.  Wildcard Matching

   A _Subscriber_ requests *wildcard-matching policy* with a
   subscription request by setting

       SUBSCRIBE.Options.match|string := "wildcard"

   Wildcard-matching allows to provide wildcards for *whole* URI
   components.

   _Example_

       [
           32,
           912873614,
           {
               "match": "wildcard"
           },
           "com.myapp..userevent"
       ]

   In above subscription request, the 3rd URI component is empty, which
   signals a wildcard in that URI component position.  In this example,
   events with PUBLISH.Topic

   *  com.myapp.foo.userevent
   *  com.myapp.bar.userevent
   *  com.myapp.a12.userevent

   will all apply for dispatching.  Events with PUBLISH.Topic

   *  com.myapp.foo.userevent.bar
   *  com.myapp.foo.user
   *  com.myapp2.foo.userevent

   will not apply for dispatching.

4.5.3.  Design Aspects

   *No set semantics*

   Since each _Subscriber's_ subscription "stands on its own", there is
   no _set semantics_ implied by pattern-based subscriptions.

   E.g. a _Subscriber_ cannot subscribe to a broad pattern, and then
   unsubscribe from a subset of that broad pattern to form a more
   complex subscription.  Each subscription is separate.

   *Events matching multiple subscriptions*

   When a single event matches more than one of a _Subscriber's_
   subscriptions, the event will be delivered for each subscription.

   The _Subscriber_ can detect the delivery of that same event on
   multiple subscriptions via EVENT.PUBLISHED.Publication, which will be
   identical.

   *Concrete topic published to*

   If a subscription was established with a pattern-based matching
   policy, a _Broker_ MUST supply the original PUBLISH.Topic as provided
   by the _Publisher_ in

       EVENT.Details.topic|uri

   to the _Subscribers_.

   _Example_

       [
           36,
           5512315355,
           4429313566,
           {
               "topic": "com.myapp.topic.emergency.category.severe"
           },
           ["Hello, world!"]
       ]

4.6.  Sharded Subscription

   Feature status: *alpha*

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Publishers_ (role :=
   "publisher"), _Subscribers_ (role := "subscriber") and _Brokers_
   (role := "broker") via

       HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.shareded_subscriptions|
           bool := true

   Resource keys: PUBLISH.Options.rkey|string is a stable, technical
   *resource key*.

   |  E.g. if your sensor has a unique serial identifier, you can use
   |  that.

   _Example_

       [16, 239714735, {"rkey": "sn239019"}, "com.myapp.sensor.sn239019.
           temperature", [33.9]]

   Node keys: SUBSCRIBE.Options.nkey|string is a stable, technical *node
   key*.

   |  E.g. if your backend process runs on a dedicated host, you can use
   |  its hostname.

   _Example_

       [32, 912873614, {"match": "wildcard", "nkey": "node23"},
           "com.myapp.sensor..temperature"]

4.7.  Event History

   Instead of complex QoS for message delivery, a _Broker_ may provide
   _Event History_. With event history, a _Subscriber_ is responsible
   for handling overlaps (duplicates) when it wants "exactly-once"
   message processing across restarts.

   The event history may be transient, or it may be persistent where it
   survives _Broker_ restarts.

   The _Broker_ implementation may allow for configuration of event
   history on a per-topic or per-topic-pattern basis.  Such
   configuration could enable/disable the feature, set the event history
   storage location, set parameters for sub-features such as
   compression, or set the event history data retention policy.

   Event History saves events published to discrete subscriptions, in
   the chronological order received by the broker.  Let us examine an
   example.

   4.  Publication to topic 'com.mycompany.log.basket'.  Delivered as
       events subscriptions 2 and 3.
   5.  Publication to topic 'com.mycompany.log.checkout'.  Delivered as
       an event to subscription 3 only.

   Event History:

   *  Event history for subscription 1 contains publication 1 only.
   *  Event history for subscription 2 contains publications 2, 3, and

   *Feature Announcement*

   A _Broker_ that implements _event history_ must indicate
   HELLO.roles.broker.features.event_history = true, must announce the
   role HELLO.roles.callee, and must provide the meta procedures
   described below.

   *Receiving Event History*

      -  before_publication.  Positive integer.  Optional.  Events in

         given publication|id (excludes the event with the given
         publication|id in the results).  Useful for pagination: pass

   It is possible to pass multiple options at the same time.  In this
   case they will be treated as conditions with logical AND.  Note that
   the publication|id event attribute is not ordered as it belongs to
   the Global scope.  But since events are stored in the order they are
   received by the broker, it is possible to find an event with the
   specified publication|id and then return events including or
   excluding the matched one depending on the *_publication filter
   attributes.

   The arguments payload field returned by the above RPC uses the same
   schema: an array of Event objects containing an additional timestamp
   string attribute in RFC3339 (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt)
   format.  It can also be an empty array in the case where there were
   no publications to the specified subscription, or all events were
   filtered out by the specified criteria.  Additional general
   information about the query may be returned via the argumentsKw
   payload field.

     [
       {
           "timestamp": "yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss.SSSZ", // string with event date/time in RFC3339 format
           "subscription": 2342423, // The subscription ID of the event
           "publication": 32445235, // The original publication ID of the event
           "details": {},           // The original details of the event
           "args": [],              // The original list arguments payload of the event. May be ommited
           "kwargs": {}             // The original key-value arguments payload of the event. May be ommited
       }
     ]

   Clients should not rely on timestamps being unique and monotonic.
   When events occur in quick succession, it's possible for some of them
   to have the same timestamp.  When a router in an IoT system is
   deployed off-grid and is not synchronized to an NTP server, it's
   possible for the timestamps to jump backwards when the router's wall
   clock time or time zone is manually adjusted.

   In cases where the events list is too large to send as a single RPC
   result, router implementations may provide additional options, such
   as pagination or returning progressive results.

   As the Event History feature operates on subscription|id, there can
   be situations when there are not yet any subscribers to a topic of
   interest, but publications to the topic occur.  In this situation,
   the _Broker_ cannot predict that events under that topic should be
   stored.  If the _Broker_ implementation allows configuration on a
   per-topic basis, it may overcome this situations by preinitializing
   history-enabled topics with "dummy" subscriptions even if there are
   not yet any real subscribers to those topics.

   Sometimes, a client may not be willing to subscribe to a topic just
   for the purpose of obtaining a subscription id.  In that case a
   client may use other Subscriptions Meta API RPC (#name-procedures-3)
   for retrieving subscription IDs by topic URIs if the router supports
   it.

   *Security Aspects*

   TODO/FIXME: This part of Event History needs more discussion and
   clarification.  But at least provides some basic information to take
   into account.

   In order to request event history, a peer must be allowed to
   subscribe to a desired subscription first.  Thus, if a peer cannot
   subscribe to a topic resulting in a subscription, it means that it
   cannot receive events history for that topic either.  To sidestep
   this problem, a peer must be allowed to call related meta procedures
   for obtaining the event history as described above.  Prohibited Event
   History meta procedure calls must fail with the
   wamp.error.not_authorized error URI.

   Original publications may include additional options, such as black-
   white-listing that triggers special event processing.  These same
   rules must also apply to event history requests.  For example, if the
   original publication contains eligible_authrole = 'admin', but the
   request for history came from a peer with authrole = 'user', then
   even if user is authorized to subscribe to the topic (and thus is
   authorized to ask for event history), this publication must be
   filtered out from the results of this specific request, by the router
   side.

   The black-white-listing feature also allows the filtering of event
   delivery on a session ID basis.  In the context of event history,
   this can result in unexpected behaviour: session ids are generated
   randomly at runtime for every session establishment, so newly
   connected sessions asking for event history may receive events that
   were originally excluded, or, vice versa, may not receive expected
   events due to session ID mismatch.  To prevent this unexpected
   behaviour, all events published with Options.exclude|list[int] or
   Options.eligible|list[int] should be ignored by the Event History
   mechanism and not be saved at all.

   Finally, Event History should only filter according to attributes
   that do not change during the run time of the router, which are
   currently authrole and authid.  Filtering based on ephemeral
   attributes like session ID – (U+2013) and perhaps other future custom
   attributes – (U+2013) should result in the event not being stored in
   the history at all, to avoid unintentional leaking of event
   information.

4.8.  Event Retention

   Event Retention is where a particular topic has an event associated
   with it which is delivered upon an opting-in client subscribing to
   the topic.

   It can be used for topics that generally have single or very few
   Publishers notifying Subscribers of a single updating piece of data
   -- for example, a topic where a sensor publishes changes of
   temperature & humidity in a data center.  It may do this every time
   the data changes (making the time between updates potentially very
   far apart), which causes an issue for new Subscribers who may need
   the last-known value upon connection, rather than waiting an unknown
   period of time until it is updated.  Event Retention covers this use
   case by allowing the Publisher to mark a event as 'retained', bound
   to the topic it was sent to, which can be delivered upon a new client
   subscription that asks for it.  It is similar to Event History, but
   allows the publisher to decide what the most important recent event
   is on the topic, even if other events are being delivered.

   A _Broker_ that advertises support MAY provide _event retention_ on
   topics it provides.  This event retention SHOULD be provided on a
   best-effort basis, and MUST NOT be interpreted as permanent or
   reliable storage by clients.  This event retention is limited to one
   event that all subscribers would receive, and MAY include other
   supplemental events that have limited distribution (for example, a
   event published with subscriber black/whitelisting).

   A _Publisher_ can request storage of a new Retained Event by setting
   Publish.Options.retain|bool to true.  Lack of the key in
   Publish.Options MUST be interpreted as a false value.  A Broker MAY
   decline to provide event retention on certain topics by ignoring the
   Publish.Options.retain value.  Brokers that allow event retention on
   the given topic MUST set the topic Retained Event to this if it were
   eligible to be published on the topic.

   _Subscribers_ may request access to the Retained Event by setting
   Subscribe.Options.get_retained|bool to true.  Lack of the key in
   Subscribe.Options MUST be interpreted as a false value.  When they
   opt-in to receiving the Retained Event, the Broker MUST send the
   Subscriber the *most recent* Retained Event that they would have
   received if they were subscribing when it was published.  The Broker
   MUST NOT send the Subscriber a Retained Event that they would not be
   eligible to receive if they were subscribing when it was published.
   The _Retained Event_, as sent to the subscribing client, MUST have
   Event.Details.retained|bool set to true, to inform subscribers that
   it is not an immediately new message.

   *Feature Announcement*

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Brokers_ (role :=
   "broker") via

      Welcome.Details.roles.broker.features.event_retention|bool := true

4.9.  Subscription Revocation

   Feature status: *alpha*

   This feature allows a _Broker_ to actively revoke a previously
   granted subscription.  To achieve this, the existing UNSUBSCRIBED
   message is extended as described below.

   *Feature Announcement*

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Subscribers_ (role :=
   "subscriber") and _Brokers_ (role := "broker") via

       HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.
            subscription_revocation|bool := true

   If the _Subscriber_ does not support subscription_revocation, the
   _Broker_ MAY still revoke a subscription to support administrative
   functionality.  In this case, the _Broker_ MUST NOT send an
   *UNSUBSCRIBED* message to the _Subscriber_. The _Subscriber_ MAY use
   the subscription meta event wamp.subscription.on_unsubscribe to
   determine whether a session is removed from a subscription.

   *Extending UNSUBSCRIBED*

   When revoking a subscription, the router has no request ID to reply
   to.  So it's set to zero and another argument is appended to indicate
   which subscription to revoke.  Optionally, a reason why the
   subscription was revoked is also appended.

       [UNSUBSCRIBED, 0, Details|dict]

   where

   *  Details.subscription|bool MUST be a previously issued subscription
      ID.
   *  Details.reason|string MAY provide a reason as to why the
      subscription was revoked.

   _Example_

    [35, 0, {"subscription": 1293722, "reason": "no longer authorized"}]

4.10.  Session Testament

   When a WAMP client disconnects, or the WAMP session is destroyed, it
   may want to notify other subscribers or publish some fixed data.
   Since a client may disconnect uncleanly, this can't be done reliably
   by them.  A _Testament_, however, set on the server, can be reliably
   sent by the _Broker_ once either the WAMP session has detached or the
   client connection has been lost, and allows this functionality.  It
   can be triggered when a Session is either detached (the client has
   disconnected from it, or frozen it, in the case of Session
   Resumption) or destroyed (when the WAMP session no longer exists on
   the server).

   This allows clients that otherwise would not be able to know when
   other clients disconnect get a notification (for example, by using
   the WAMP Session Meta API) with a format the disconnected client
   chose.

   *Feature Announcement*

   Support for this feature MUST be announced by _Dealers_ (role :=
   "dealer") via

       HELLO.Details.roles.dealer.features.
           testament_meta_api|bool := true

   *Testament Meta Procedures*

   A _Client_ can call the following procedures to set/flush Testaments:

   *  wamp.session.add_testament to add a Testament which will be
      published on a particular topic when the Session is detached or
      destroyed.
   *  wamp.session.flush_testaments to remove the Testaments for that
      Session, either for when it is detached or destroyed.

   *wamp.session.add_testament*

   Adds a new testament:

   _Positional arguments_

   1.  topic|uri - the topic to publish the event on
   2.  args|list - positional arguments for the event
   3.  kwargs|dict - keyword arguments for the event

   _Keyword arguments_

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-AP                  September 2025


   1.  publish_options|dict - options for the event when it is published
       -- see Publish.Options.  Not all options may be honoured (for
       example, acknowledge).  By default, there are no options.
   2.  scope|string - When the testament should be published.  Valid
       values are detached (when the WAMP session is detached, for
       example, when using Event Retention) or destroyed (when the WAMP
       session is finalized and destroyed on the Broker).  Default MUST
       be destroyed.

   wamp.session.add_testament does not return a value.

   *wamp.session.flush_testaments*

   Removes testaments for the given scope:

   _Keyword arguments_

   1.  scope|string - Which set of testaments to be removed.  Valid
       values are the same as wamp.session.add_testament, and the
       default MUST be destroyed.

   wamp.session.flush_testaments does not return a value.

   *Testaments in Use*

   A _Client_ that wishes to send some form of data when their _Session_
   ends unexpectedly or their _Transport_ becomes lost can set a
   testament using the WAMP Testament Meta API, when a _Router_ supports
   it.  For example, a client may call add_testament (this example uses
   the implicit scope option of destroyed):

   yield self.call('wamp.session.add_testament',
                   'com.myapp.mytopic', ['Seeya!'], {'my_name': 'app1'})

   The _Router_ will then store this information on the WAMP Session,
   either in a detached or destroyed bucket, in the order they were
   added.  A client MUST be able to set multiple testaments per-scope.
   If the _Router_ does not support Session Resumption (therefore
   removing the distinction between a detached and destroyed session),
   it MUST still use these two separate buckets to allow
   wamp.session.flush_testaments to work.

   When a _Session_ is _detached_, the _Router_ will inspect it for any
   Testaments in the detached scope, and publish them in the order that
   the Router received them, on the specified topic, with the specified
   arguments, keyword arguments, and publish options.  The _Router_ MAY
   ignore publish options that do not make sense for a Testament (for
   example, acknowledged publishes).

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-AP                  September 2025


   When a _Session_ is going to be _destroyed_, the _Router_ will
   inspect it for any Testaments in the destroyed scope, and publish
   them in the same way as it would for the detached scope, in the order
   that they were received.

   A _Router_ that does not allow Session Resumption MUST send detached-
   scope Testaments before destroyed-scope Testaments.

   A _Client_ can also clear testaments if the information is no longer
   relevant (for example, it is shutting down completely cleanly).  For
   example, a client may call wamp.session.flush_testaments:

   yield self.call('wamp.session.flush_testaments', scope='detached')
   yield self.call('wamp.session.flush_testaments', scope='destroyed')

   The _Router_ will then flush all Testaments stored for the given
   scope.

5.  Authentication Methods

   Authentication is a complex area.  Some applications might want to
   leverage authentication information coming from the transport
   underlying WAMP, e.g. HTTP cookies or TLS certificates.

   Some transports might imply trust or implicit authentication by their
   very nature, e.g. Unix domain sockets with appropriate file system
   permissions in place.

   Other application might want to perform their own authentication
   using external mechanisms (completely outside and independent of
   WAMP).

   Some applications might want to perform their own authentication
   schemes by using basic WAMP mechanisms, e.g. by using application-
   defined remote procedure calls.

   And some applications might want to use a transport independent
   scheme, nevertheless predefined by WAMP.

   *WAMP-level Authentication*

   The message flow between Clients and Routers for establishing and
   tearing down sessions MAY involve the following messages which
   authenticate a session:

   1.  CHALLENGE
   2.  AUTHENTICATE

        |Client|          |Router|
        `------'          `------'

   Concrete use of CHALLENGE and AUTHENTICATE messages depends on the
   specific authentication method.

   See WAMP Challenge-Response Authentication (#wampcra) or ticket
   authentication (#ticketauth) for the use in these authentication
   methods.

   If two-factor authentication is desired, then two subsequent rounds
   of CHALLENGE and RESPONSE may be employed.

   _CHALLENGE_

   An authentication MAY be required for the establishment of a session.
   Such requirement MAY be based on the Realm the connection is
   requested for.

   To request authentication, the Router MUST send a CHALLENGE message
   to the _Endpoint_.

       [CHALLENGE, AuthMethod|string, Extra|dict]

   _AUTHENTICATE_

   In response to a CHALLENGE message, the Client MUST send an
   AUTHENTICATE message.

       [AUTHENTICATE, Signature|string, Extra|dict]

   If the authentication succeeds, the Router MUST send a WELCOME
   message, else it MUST send an ABORT message.

   *Transport-level Authentication*

   _Cookie-based Authentication_

   When running WAMP over WebSocket, the transport provides HTTP client
   cookies during the WebSocket opening handshake.  The cookies can be
   used to authenticate one peer (the client) against the other (the
   server).  The other authentication direction cannot be supported by
   cookies.

   This transport-level authentication information may be forwarded to
   the WAMP level within HELLO.Details.transport.auth|any in the client-
   to-server direction.

   _TLS Certificate Authentication_

   When running WAMP over a TLS (either secure WebSocket or raw TCP)
   transport, a peer may authenticate to the other via the TLS
   certificate mechanism.  A server might authenticate to the client,
   and a client may authenticate to the server (TLS client-certificate
   based authentication).

   This transport-level authentication information may be forwarded to
   the WAMP level within HELLO.Details.transport.auth|any in both
   directions (if available).

5.1.  Ticket-based Authentication

   With _Ticket-based authentication_, the client needs to present the
   server an authentication "ticket" - some magic value to authenticate
   itself to the server.

   This "ticket" could be a long-lived, pre-agreed secret (e.g. a user
   password) or a short-lived authentication token (like a Kerberos
   token).  WAMP does not care or interpret the ticket presented by the
   client.

   |  Caution: This scheme is extremely simple and flexible, but the
   |  resulting security may be limited.  E.g., the ticket value will be
   |  sent over the wire.  If the transport WAMP is running over is not
   |  encrypted, a man-in-the-middle can sniff and possibly hijack the
   |  ticket.  If the ticket value is reused, that might enable replay
   |  attacks.

   A typical authentication begins with the client sending a HELLO
   message specifying the ticket method as (one of) the authentication
   methods:

         {
           "roles": ...,
           "authmethods": ["ticket"],
           "authid": "joe"
         }
       ]

   The HELLO.Details.authmethods|list is used by the client to announce
   the authentication methods it is prepared to perform.  For Ticket-
   based, this MUST include "ticket".

   The HELLO.Details.authid|string is the authentication ID (e.g.
   username) the client wishes to authenticate as.  For Ticket-based
   authentication, this MUST be provided.

   If the server is unwilling or unable to perform Ticket-based
   authentication, it'll either skip forward trying other authentication
   methods (if the client announced any) or send an ABORT message.

   If the server is willing to let the client authenticate using a
   ticket and the server recognizes the provided authid, it'll send a
   CHALLENGE message:

       [4, "ticket", {}]

   The client will send an AUTHENTICATE message containing a ticket:

       [5, "secret!!!", {}]

   The server will then check if the ticket provided is permissible (for
   the authid given).

   If the authentication succeeds, the server will finally respond with
   a WELCOME message:

   4.  authprovider|string: The actual provider of authentication.  For
       Ticket-based authentication, this can be freely chosen by the
       app, e.g. static or dynamic.

   The WELCOME.Details again contain the actual authentication
   information active.  If the authentication fails, the server will
   response with an ABORT message.

5.2.  Challenge Response Authentication

   WAMP Challenge-Response ("WAMP-CRA") authentication is a simple,
   secure authentication mechanism using a shared secret.  The client
   and the server share a secret.  The secret never travels the wire,
   hence WAMP-CRA can be used via non-TLS connections.  The actual pre-
   sharing of the secret is outside the scope of the authentication
   mechanism.

   A typical authentication begins with the client sending a HELLO
   message specifying the wampcra method as (one of) the authentication
   methods:

       [1, "realm1",
           {
               "roles": ...,
               "authmethods": ["wampcra"],
               "authid": "peter"
           }
       ]

   The HELLO.Details.authmethods|list is used by the client to announce
   the authentication methods it is prepared to perform.  For WAMP-CRA,
   this MUST include "wampcra".

   The HELLO.Details.authid|string is the authentication ID (e.g.
   username) the client wishes to authenticate as.  For WAMP-CRA, this
   MUST be provided.

   If the server is unwilling or unable to perform WAMP-CRA
   authentication, it MAY either skip forward trying other
   authentication methods (if the client announced any) or send an ABORT
   message.

   If the server is willing to let the client authenticate using WAMP-
   CRA, and the server recognizes the provided authid, it MUST send a
   CHALLENGE message:

       [4, "wampcra",
           {
               "challenge": "{ \"nonce\": \"LHRTC9zeOIrt_9U3\",
                   \"authprovider\": \"userdb\", \"authid\": \"peter\",
                   \"timestamp\": \"2014-06-22T16:36:25.448Z\",
                   \"authrole\": \"user\", \"authmethod\": \"wampcra\",
                   \"session\": 3251278072152162}"
           }
       ]

   The CHALLENGE.Details.challenge|string is a string the client needs
   to create a signature for.  The string MUST BE a JSON serialized
   object which MUST contain:

   1.  authid|string: The authentication ID the client will be
       authenticated as when the authentication succeeds.
   2.  authrole|string: The authentication role the client will be
       authenticated as when the authentication succeeds.
   3.  authmethod|string: The authentication methods, here "wampcra"
   4.  authprovider|string: The actual provider of authentication.  For
       WAMP-CRA, this can be freely chosen by the app, e.g. userdb.
   5.  nonce|string: A random value.
   6.  timestamp|string: The UTC timestamp (ISO8601 format) the
       authentication was started, e.g. 2014-06-22T16:51:41.643Z.
   7.  session|int: The WAMP session ID that will be assigned to the
       session once it is authenticated successfully.

   The client needs to compute the signature as follows:

       signature := HMAC[SHA256]_{secret} (challenge)

   That is, compute the HMAC-SHA256 using the shared secret over the
   challenge.

   After computing the signature, the client will send an AUTHENTICATE
   message containing the signature, as a base64-encoded string:

       [5, "gir1mSx+deCDUV7wRM5SGIn/+R/ClqLZuH4m7FJeBVI=", {}]

   The server will then check if

   *  the signature matches the one expected
   *  the AUTHENTICATE message was sent in due time

       [2, 3251278072152162,
           {
               "authid": "peter",
               "authrole": "user",
               "authmethod": "wampcra",
               "authprovider": "userdb",
               "roles": ...
           }
       ]

   The WELCOME.Details again contain the actual authentication
   information active.

   If the authentication fails, the server will response with an ABORT
   message.

   *Server-side Verification*

   The challenge sent during WAMP-CRA contains

   1.  random information (the nonce) to make WAMP-CRA robust against
       replay attacks
   2.  timestamp information (the timestamp) to allow WAMP-CRA timeout
       on authentication requests that took too long
   3.  session information (the session) to bind the authentication to a
       WAMP session ID
   4.  all the authentication information that relates to authorization
       like authid and authrole

   *Three-legged Authentication*

   The signing of the challenge sent by the server usually is done
   directly on the client.  However, this is no strict requirement.

   E.g. a client might forward the challenge to another party (hence the
   "three-legged") for creating the signature.  This can be used when
   the client was previously already authenticated to that third party,
   and WAMP-CRA should run piggy packed on that authentication.

   The third party would, upon receiving a signing request, simply check
   if the client is already authenticated, and if so, create a signature
   for WAMP-CRA.

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-AP                  September 2025


   In this case, the secret is actually shared between the WAMP server
   who wants to authenticate clients using WAMP-CRA and the third party
   server, who shares a secret with the WAMP server.

   This scenario is also the reason the challenge sent with WAMP-CRA is
   not simply a random value, but a JSON serialized object containing
   sufficient authentication information for the third party to check.

   *Password Salting*

   WAMP-CRA operates using a shared secret.  While the secret is never
   sent over the wire, a shared secret often requires storage of that
   secret on the client and the server - and storing a password verbatim
   (unencrypted) is not recommended in general.

   WAMP-CRA allows the use of salted passwords following the PBKDF2
   (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2) key derivation scheme.  With
   salted passwords, the password itself is never stored, but only a key
   derived from the password and a password salt.  This derived key is
   then practically working as the new shared secret.

   When the password is salted, the server will during WAMP-CRA send a
   CHALLENGE message containing additional information:

       [4, "wampcra",
           {
               "challenge": "{ \"nonce\": \"LHRTC9zeOIrt_9U3\",
                   \"authprovider\": \"userdb\", \"authid\": \"peter\",
                   \"timestamp\": \"2014-06-22T16:36:25.448Z\",
                   \"authrole\": \"user\", \"authmethod\": \"wampcra\",
                   \"session\": 3251278072152162}",
               "salt": "salt123",
               "keylen": 32,
               "iterations": 1000
           }
       ]

   The CHALLENGE.Details.salt|string is the password salt in use.  The
   CHALLENGE.Details.keylen|int and CHALLENGE.Details.iterations|int are
   parameters for the PBKDF2 algorithm.

5.3.  Salted Challenge Response Authentication

   The WAMP Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism ("WAMP-
   SCRAM"), is a password-based authentication method where the shared
   secret is neither transmitted nor stored as cleartext.  WAMP-SCRAM is
   based on RFC5802 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802) (_Salted
   Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism_) and RFC7677
   (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7677) (_SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-
   256-PLUS_).

   WAMP-SCRAM supports the Argon2 (draft-irtf-cfrg-argon2
   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-argon2/)) password-
   based key derivation function, a memory-hard algorithm intended to
   resist cracking on GPU hardware.  PBKDF2 (RFC2898
   (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2898)) is also supported for
   applications that are required to use primitives currently approved
   by cryptographic standards.

   *Security Considerations*

   With WAMP-SCRAM, if the authentication database is stolen, an
   attacker cannot impersonate a user unless they guess the password
   offline by brute force.

   In the event that the server's authentication database is stolen, and
   the attacker either eavesdrops on one authentication exchange or
   impersonates a server, the attacker gains the ability to impersonate
   that particular user on that server.  If the same salt is used on
   other servers, the attacker would gain the ability to impersonate
   that user on all servers using the same salt.  That's why it's
   important to use a per-user random salt.

   An eavesdropper that captures a user authentication exchange has
   enough information to mount an offline, brute-force dictionary attack
   for that particular user.  If passwords are sufficiently strong, the
   cost/time needed to crack a password becomes prohibitive.

   Note that when HTML/JavaScript assets are served to a web browser,
   WAMP-SCRAM does not safeguard against a man-in-the-middle tampering
   with those assets.  Those assets could be tampered with in a way that
   captures the user's password and sends it to the attacker.

   In light of the above security concerns, a secure TLS transport is
   therefore advised to prevent such attacks.  The channel binding
   feature of SCRAM can be used to ensure that the TLS endpoints are the
   same between client and router.

   *Deviations from RFC5802*

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-AP                  September 2025


   1.  To simplify parsing, SCRAM attributes in the authentication
       exchange messages are encoded as members of the Options/Details
       objects without escaping the , and = characters.  However, the
       AuthMessage used to compute the client and server signatures DOES
       use the exact syntax specified in RFC5802, section 7
       (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802#section-7).  This makes it
       possible to use existing test vectors to verify WAMP-SCRAM
       implementations.

   2.  Hashing based on the weaker SHA-1 specified in RFC5802
       (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802) is intentionally not
       supported by WAMP-SCRAM, in favor of the stronger SHA-256
       specified in RFC7677 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7677).

   3.  The Argon2 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-
       argon2) key derivation function MAY be used instead of PBKDF2.

   4.  Nonces are required to be base64-encoded, which is stricter than
       the printable syntax specification of RFC5802
       (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802).

   5.  The "y" channel binding flag is not used as there is currently no
       standard way for WAMP routers to announce channel binding
       capabilities.

   6.  The use of authzid for user impersonation is not supported.

   *authmethod Type String*

   "wamp-scram" SHALL be used as the authmethod type string for WAMP-
   SCRAM authentication.  Announcement by routers of WAMP-SCRAM support
   is outside the scope of this document.

   *Base64 encoding*

   Base64 encoding of octet strings is restricted to canonical form with
   no whitespace, as defined in RFC4648 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/
   rfc4648) (_The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings_).

   *Nonces*

   In WAMP-SCRAM, a _nonce_ (number used once) is a base64-encoded
   sequence of random octets.  It SHOULD be of sufficient length to make
   a replay attack unfeasible.  A length of 16 octets (128 bits) is
   recommended for each of the client and server-generated nonces.

   See RFC4086 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4086) (_Randomness
   Requirements for Security_) for best practices concerning randomness.

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-AP                  September 2025


   *Salts*

   A _salt_ is a base64-encoded sequence of random octets.

   To prevent rainbow table attacks in the event of database theft, the
   salt MUST be generated randomly by the server *for each user*. The
   random salt is stored with each user record in the authentication
   database.

   *Username/Password String Normalization*

   Username and password strings SHALL be normalized according to the
   _SASLprep_ profile described in RFC4013 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/
   rfc4013), using the _stringprep_ algorithm described in RFC3454
   (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3454).

   While SASLprep preserves the case of usernames, the server MAY choose
   to perform case insensitive comparisons when searching for a username
   in the authentication database.

   *Channel Binding*

   _Channel binding_ is a feature that allows a higher layer to
   establish that the other end of an underlying secure channel is bound
   to its higher layer counterpart.  See RFC5056
   (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5056) (_On the Use of Channel
   Bindings_) for an in-depth discussion.

   RFC5929 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5929) defines binding types
   for use with TLS transports, of which tls-unique and tls-server-end-
   point are applicable for WAMP-SCRAM.  For each channel binding type,
   there is a corresponding definition of the _channel binding data_
   that must be sent in response to the authentication challenge.

   Negotiation and announcement of channel binding is outside the scope
   of this document.  RFC5929 section 6 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/
   rfc5929#section-6) recommends that application protocols use tls-
   unique exclusively, except perhaps where server-side proxies are
   commonly deployed.

   Note that WAMP-SCRAM channel binding is not generally possible with
   web browser clients due to the lack of a suitable API for this
   purpose.

   _The tls-unique Channel Binding Type_






Oberstein                 Expires 28 March 2026                [Page 95]

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-AP                  September 2025


   The tls-unique channel binding type allows the WAMP layer to
   establish that the other peer is authenticating over the same, unique
   TLS connection.  The channel binding data for this type corresponds
   to the bytes of the first TLS Finished message, as described in
   RFC5929, section 3 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5929#section-3).
   RFC5929 section 10.2 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5929#section-
   10.2) addresses the concern of disclosing this data over the TLS
   channel (in short, the TLS Finished message would already be visible
   to eavesdroppers).

   To safeguard against the _triple handshake attack_ described in
   RFC7627 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7627), this channel binding
   type MUST be used over a TLS channel that uses the _extended master
   secret_ extension, or over a TLS channel where session resumption is
   not permitted.

   _The tls-server-end-point Channel Binding Type_

   The tls-server-end-point channel binding type allows the WAMP layer
   to establish that the other peer is authenticating over a TLS
   connection to a server having been issued a Public Key Infrastructure
   Certificate.  The channel binding data for this type is a hash of the
   TLS server's certificate, computed as described in RFC5929, section
   4.1 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5929#section-4.1).  The
   certificate is hashed to accommodate memory-constrained
   implementations.

   *Authentication Exchange*

   WAMP-SCRAM uses a single round of challenge/response pairs after the
   client authentication request and before the authentication outcome.

   The mapping of RFC5802 messages to WAMP messages is as follows:

   _Initial Client Authentication Message_

   WAMP-SCRAM authentication begins with the client sending a HELLO
   message specifying the wamp-scram method as (one of) the
   authentication methods:

       [1, "realm1",
           {
               "roles": ...,
               "authmethods": ["wamp-scram"],
               "authid": "user",
               "authextra":
                   {
                       "nonce": "egVDf3DMJh0=",
                       "channel_binding": null
                   }

           }
       ]

   where:

   1.  authid|string: The identity of the user performing
       authentication.  This corresponds to the username parameter in
       RFC5802.
   2.  authextra.nonce|string: A base64-encoded sequence of random
       octets, generated by the client.  See Nonces (#nonces).
   3.  authextra.channel_binding|string: Optional string containing the
       desired channel binding type.  See Channel Bindings (#channel-
       binding).

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-AP                  September 2025


   Upon receiving the HELLO message, the server MUST terminate the
   authentication process by sending an ABORT message under any of the
   following circumstances:

   *  The server does not support the WAMP-SCRAM authmethods, and there
      are no other methods left that the server supports for this
      authid.
   *  The the server does not support the requested channel_binding
      type.
   *  (Optional) The server does not recognize the given authid.  In
      this case, the server MAY proceed with a mock CHALLENGE message to
      avoid leaking information on the existence of usernames.  This
      mock CHALLENGE SHOULD contain a generated salt value that is
      always the same for a given authid, otherwise an attacker may
      discover that the user doesn't actually exist.

   _Initial Server Authentication Message_

   If none of the above failure conditions apply, and the server is
   ready to let the client authenticate using WAMP-SCRAM, then it SHALL
   send a CHALLENGE message:

       [4, "wamp-scram",
           {
               "nonce": "egVDf3DMJh0=SBmkFIh7sSo=",
               "salt": "aBc+fx0NAVA=",
               "kdf": "pbkdf2",
               "iterations": 4096,
               "memory": null
           }
       ]

   where:

   1.  nonce|string: A server-generated nonce that is appended to the
       client-generated nonce sent in the previous HELLO message.  See
       Nonces (#nonces).
   2.  salt|string: The base64-encoded salt for this user, to be passed
       to the key derivation function.  This value is stored with each
       user record in the authentication database.  See Salts (#salts).
   3.  kdf: The key derivation function (KDF) used to hash the password.
       This value is stored with each user record in the authentication
       database.  See Key Derivation Functions (#key-derivation-
       functions).
   4.  iterations|integer: The execution time cost factor to use for
       generating the SaltedPassword hash.  This value is stored with
       each user record in the authentication database.

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-AP                  September 2025


   5.  memory|integer: The memory cost factor to use for generating the
       SaltedPassword hash.  This is only used by the Argon2 key
       derivation function, where it is stored with each user record in
       the authentication database.

   The client MUST respond with an ABORT message if
   CHALLENGE.Details.nonce does not begin with the client nonce sent in
   HELLO.Details.nonce.

   The client SHOULD respond with an ABORT message if it detects that
   the cost parameters are unusually low.  Such low-cost parameters
   could be the result of a rogue server attempting to obtain a weak
   password hash that can be easily cracked.  What constitutes unusually
   low parameters is implementation-specific and is not covered by this
   document.

   _Final Client Authentication Message_

   Upon receiving a valid CHALLENGE message, the client SHALL respond
   with an AUTHENTICATE message:

       [5, "dHzbZapWIk4jUhN+Ute9ytag9zjfMHgsqmmiz7AndVQ=",
           {
               "nonce": "egVDf3DMJh0=SBmkFIh7sSo=",
               "channel_binding": null,
               "cbind_data": null
           }
       ]

   where:

   1.  Signature|string argument: The base64-encoded ClientProof,
       computed as described in the SCRAM-Algorithms (#scram-algorithms)
       section.
   2.  nonce|string: The concatenated client-server nonce from the
       previous CHALLENGE message.
   3.  channel_binding|string: Optional string containing the channel
       binding type that was sent in the original HELLO message.
   4.  cbind_data|string: Optional base64-encoded channel binding data.
       MUST be present if and only if channel_binding is not null.  The
       format of the binding data is dependent on the binding type.  See
       Channel Binding (#channel-binding).

   Upon receiving the AUTHENTICATE message, the server SHALL then check
   that:

   *  The AUTHENTICATE message was received in due time.

   *  The ClientProof passed via the Signature|string argument is
      validated against the StoredKey and ServerKey stored in the
      authentication database.  See SCRAM Algorithms (#scram-
      algorithms).
   *  nonce matches the one previously sent via CHALLENGE.
   *  The channel_binding matches the one sent in the HELLO message.
   *  The cbind_data sent by the client matches the channel binding data
      that the server sees on its side of the channel.

   _Final Server Authentication Message - Success_

   If the authentication succeeds, the server SHALL finally respond with
   a WELCOME message:

       [2, 3251278072152162,
           {
               "authid": "user",

                   }
           }
       ]

   where:

   1.  authid|string: The authentication ID the client was actually
       authenticated as.
   2.  authrole|string: The authentication role the client was
       authenticated for.
   3.  authmethod|string: The authentication method, here "wamp-scram".
   4.  authprovider|string: The actual provider of authentication.  For
       WAMP-SCRAM authentication, this can be freely chosen by the app,
       e.g. static or dynamic.
   5.  authextra.verifier|string: The base64-encoded ServerSignature,
       computed as described in the SCRAM Algorithms (#scram-algorithms)
       section.

   The client SHOULD check the verifier for mutual authentication,
   terminating the session if invalid.

   If the authentication fails, the server SHALL respond with an ABORT
   message.

   The server MAY include a SCRAM-specific error string in the ABORT
   message as a Details.scram attribute.  SCRAM error strings are listed

   *Data Stored on the Server*

   For each user, the server needs to store:

   1.  A random, per-user salt.
   2.  The type string corresponding to the key derivation function
       (KDF) used to hash the password (e.g. "argon2id13").  This is
       needed to handle future revisions of the KDF, as well as allowing
       migration to stronger KDFs that may be added to WAMP-SCRAM in the
       future.  This may also be needed if the KDF used during user
       registration is configurable or selectable on a per-user basis.
   3.  Parameters that are applicable to the key derivation function :
       iterations and possibly memory.
   4.  The StoredKey.
   5.  The ServerKey.

   where StoredKey and ServerKey are computed as follows:

   SaltedPassword  = KDF(Normalize(password), salt, params...)
   ClientKey       = HMAC(SaltedPassword, "Client Key")
   StoredKey       = SHA256(ClientKey)
   ServerKey       = HMAC(SaltedPassword, "Server Key")

   Note that "Client Key" and "Server Key" are string literals.

   The manner in which the StoredKey and ServerKey are shared with the
   server during user registration is outside the scope of SCRAM and
   this document.

   *AuthMessage*

   In SCRAM, AuthMessage is used for computing ClientProof and
   ServerSignature.  AuthMessage is computed using attributes that were
   sent in the first three messages of the authentication exchange.

   CBindName = AUTHENTICATE.Extra.channel_binding

   CBindData = AUTHENTICATE.Extra.cbind_data

   CBindFlag = IfNull(CBindName, "n", "p=" + CBindName)

   CBindInput = CBindFlag + ",," +
                IfNull(CBindData, "", UnBase64(CBindData))

   ClientFinalNoProof = "c=" + Base64(CBindInput) + "," +

   AuthMessage = ClientFirstBare + "," + ServerFirst + "," +
                 ClientFinalNoProof

   *ClientProof*

   ClientProof is computed by the client during the authentication
   exchange as follows:

   SaltedPassword  = KDF(Normalize(password), salt, params...)
   ClientKey       = HMAC(SaltedPassword, "Client Key")
   StoredKey       = SHA256(ClientKey)
   ClientSignature = HMAC(StoredKey, AuthMessage)
   ClientProof     = ClientKey XOR ClientSignature

   The ClientProof is then sent to the server, base64-encoded, via the
   AUTHENTICATE.Signature argument.

   The server verifies the ClientProof by computing the
   RecoveredStoredKey and comparing it to the actual StoredKey:

   ClientSignature    = HMAC(StoredKey, AuthMessage)
   RecoveredClientKey = ClientSignature XOR ReceivedClientProof
   RecoveredStoredKey = SHA256(RecoveredClientKey)

   Note that the client MAY cache the ClientKey and StoredKey (or just
   SaltedPassword) to avoid having to perform the expensive KDF
   computation for every authentication exchange.  Storing these values
   securely on the client is outside the scope of this document.

   *ServerSignature*

   ServerSignature is computed by the server during the authentication
   exchange as follows:

   ServerSignature = HMAC(ServerKey, AuthMessage)

   The ServerSignature is then sent to the client, base64-encoded, via
   the WELCOME.Details.authextra.verifier attribute.

   The client verifies the ServerSignature by computing it and comparing
   it with the ServerSignature sent by the server:

   ServerKey       = HMAC(SaltedPassword, "Server Key")
   ServerSignature = HMAC(ServerKey, AuthMessage)

   *Key Derivation Functions*

   SCRAM uses a password-based key derivation function (KDF) to hash
   user passwords.  WAMP-SCRAM supports both Argon2
   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-argon2/) and PBKDF2
   (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2898) as the KDF.  Argon2 is
   recommended because of its memory hardness and resistance against GPU
   hardware.  PBKDF2, which does not feature memory hardness, is also
   supported for applications that are required to use primitives
   currently approved by cryptographic standards.

   The following table maps the CHALLENGE.Details.kdf type string to the
   corresponding KDF.

       +=================+=========================================+
       | KDF type string | Function                                |
       +=================+=========================================+
       | "argon2id13"    | Argon2id variant of Argon2, version 1.3 |
       +-----------------+-----------------------------------------+
       | "pbkdf2"        | PBKDF2                                  |
       +-----------------+-----------------------------------------+

                                  Table 8

   To promote interoperability, WAMP-SCRAM client/server implementations
   SHOULD support both of the above KDFs.  During authentication, there
   is no "negotiation" of the KDF, and the client MUST use the same KDF
   than the one used to create the keys stored in the authentication
   database.

   Which KDF is used to hash the password during user registration is up
   to the application and/or server implementation, and is not covered
   by this document.  Possibilities include:

   *  making the KDF selectable at runtime during registration,
   *  making the KDF statically configurable on the server, or,
   *  hard-coding the KDF selection on the server.

   _Argon2_

   The Argon2 key derivation function, proposed in draft-irtf-cfrg-
   argon2 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-argon2/), is
   computed using the following parameters:

   *  CHALLENGE.Details.salt as the cryptographic salt,
   *  CHALLENGE.Details.iterations as the number of iterations,
   *  CHALLENGE.Details.memory as the memory size (in kibibytes),
   *  1 as the parallelism parameter,
   *  Argon2id as the algorithm variant, and,
   *  32 octets as the output key length.

   For WAMP-SCRAM, the parallelism parameter is fixed to 1 due to the
   password being hashed on the client side, where it is not generally
   known how many cores/threads are available on the client's device.

   Section 4 of the Argon2 internet draft recommends the general
   procedure for selecting parameters, of which the following guidelines
   are applicable to WAMP-SCRAM:

   *  A 128-bit salt is recommended, which can be reduced to 64-bit if
      space is limited.
   *  The memory parameter is to be configured to the maximum amount of
      memory usage that can be tolerated on client devices for computing
      the hash.
   *  The iterations parameter is to be determined experimentally so
      that execution time on the client reaches the maximum that can be
      tolerated by users during authentication.  If the execution time
      is intolerable with iterations = 1, then reduce the memory
      parameter as needed.

   _PBKDF2_

   The PBKDF2 key derivation function, defined in RFC2898
   (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2898), is used with SHA-256 as the
   pseudorandom function (PRF).

   The PDBKDF2 hash is computed using the following parameters:

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-AP                  September 2025


   *  CHALLENGE.Details.salt as the cryptographic salt,
   *  CHALLENGE.Details.iterations as the iteration count, and,
   *  32 octets as the output key length (dkLen), which matches the
      SHA-256 output length.

   RFC2898 section 4.1 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2898) recommends
   at least 64 bits for the salt.

   The iterations parameter SHOULD be determined experimentally so that
   execution time on the client reaches the maximum that can be
   tolerated by users during authentication.  RFC7677 section 4
   (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7677#section-4) recommends an
   iteration count of at least 4096, with a significantly higher value
   on non-mobile clients.

5.4.  Cryptosign-based Authentication

   _WAMP-Cryptosign_ is a WAMP authentication method based on _public-
   private key cryptography_. Specifically, it is based on Ed25519
   (https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) digital signatures as described in
   [RFC8032].

   *Ed25519* is an elliptic curve signature scheme
   (https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/ed25519-20110926.pdf) that instantiates the
   Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) with elliptic curve
   parameters which are equivalent to Curve25519 (https://cr.yp.to/
   ecdh.html). *Curve25519* is a SafeCurve
   (https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/), which means it is easy to implement
   and avoid security issues resulting from common implementation
   challenges and bugs.  Ed25519 is intended to operate at around the
   128-bit security level, and there are robust native implementations
   available as open-source, e.g. libsodium
   (https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium), which can be used from
   script languages, e.g. PyNaCl (https://github.com/pyca/pynacl).

   An implementation of _WAMP-Cryptosign_ MUST provide

   *  Client Authentication (#clientauth)

   and MAY implement one or more of

   *  TLS Channel Binding (#channelbinding)
   *  Router Authentication (#routerauth)
   *  Trustroots and Certificates (#trustrootcerts)
   *  Remote Attestation (#remoteattestation)

   The following sections describe each of above features of _WAMP-
   Cryptosign_.

                                  Table 11

5.4.1.  Client Authentication

   A _Client_ is authenticated to a _Router_ by:

   1.  sending a HELLO, announcing its public key
   2.  signing a (random) challenge received in CHALLENGE with its
       private key
   3.  let the router verify the signature, proofing the client actually
       controls the private key, and thus the authenticity of the client
       as identified by the public key
   4.  let the router admit the client to a realm under a role, based on
       the public key

   Thus, the client is identified using its public key, and the _Router_
   needs to know said public key and its desired realm and role in
   advance.

   A _Client_ for which the _Router_ does not previously know the
   client's public key MAY use the Trustroots and Certificates (#name-
   trustroots-and-certificates) feature to trust a _Client_ based on an
   additional certificate presented by the client.

   A _Router_ is optionally (see Router Authentication (#name-router-
   authentication)) authenticated to a _Client_ by:

   1.  client includes a (random) HELLO.Details.challenge|string
   2.  the router sends the signature as part of its challenge to the
       client, in CHALLENGE.extra.signature|string

   Again, in this case, the _Router_ includes a trustroot and
   certificate for the client to verify.

5.4.1.1.  Computing the Signature

   The challenge sent by the router is a 32 bytes random value, encoded
   as a Hex string in CHALLENGE.extra.challenge|string.

   When no channel binding is active, the Ed25519 signature over the 32
   bytes message MUST be computed using the WAMP-Cryptosign _private
   key_ of the authenticating client.

   When channel binding is active, the challenge MUST first be XOR'ed
   bytewise with the channel ID, e.g. the 32 bytes from TLS with channel
   binding "tls-unique", and the resulting message (which again has
   length 32 bytes) MUST be signed using the WAMP-Cryptosign _private
   key_ of the authenticating client.

   The client MUST return the concatenation of the signature and the
   message signed (96 bytes) in the AUTHENTICATE message.

5.4.1.2.  Example Message Flow

   A typical authentication begins with the client sending a HELLO
   message specifying the cryptosign method as (one of) the
   authentication methods:

   [1, "realm1", {
       "roles": {/* see below */},
       "authmethods": ["cryptosign"],
       "authid": "client01@example.com",
       "authextra": {
           "pubkey": "545efb0a2192db8d43f118e9bf9aee081466e1ef36c708b96ee6f62dddad9122"
       }
   }]

   The HELLO.Details.authmethods|list is used by the client to announce
   the authentication methods it is prepared to perform.  For WAMP-
   Cryptosign, this MUST include "cryptosign".

   The HELLO.Details.authid|string is the authentication ID (e.g.
   username) the client wishes to authenticate as.  For WAMP-Cryptosign
   authentication, this MAY be provided.  If no authid is provided, the
   router SHOULD automatically chose and assign an authid (e.g. the Hex
   encode public key).

   The HELLO.Details.authextra|dict contains the following members for
   WAMP-Cryptosign:

   If the router is unwilling or unable to perform WAMP-Cryptosign
   authentication, it'll either skip forward trying other authentication
   methods (if the client announced any) or send an ABORT message.

   If the router is willing to let the client authenticate using WAMP-
   Cryptosign and the router recognizes the provided

5.4.1.3.  Test Vectors

   The following test vectors allow to verify an implementation of WAMP-
   Cryptosign signatures.  You can use channel_id, private_key and
   challenge as input, and check the computed signature matches
   signature.

   The test vectors contain instances for both with and without a
   channel_id, which represents the TLS channel ID when using TLS with
   tls-unique channel binding.

5.4.2.  TLS Channel Binding

   _TLS Channel Binding_ is an optional feature for WAMP-Cryptosign when
   running on top of TLS for link encryption.  The use of "channel
   binding" to bind authentication at application layers to secure
   sessions at lower layers in the network stack protects against
   certain attack scenarios.  For more background information, please
   see

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-AP                  September 2025


   *  RFC5056: On the Use of Channel Bindings to Secure Channels
      (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5056)
   *  Binding Security Tokens to TLS Channels
      (https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/90/slides/slides-90-uta-0.pdf)

   A client that wishes to use TLS Channel Binding with WAMP-Cryptosign
   must include an attribute channel_binding in the authextra sent in
   HELLO.Details:

[1, 'realm1', {
  'authextra': {
    'channel_binding': 'tls-unique',
    'pubkey': '545efb0a2192db8d43f118e9bf9aee081466e1ef36c708b96ee6f62dddad9122'
  },
  'authmethods': ['cryptosign']
  }]

   The channel_binding, if present, MUST be a string with a value of
   tls-unique or tls-exporter, to specify the channel binding type that
   is to be used:

   *  tls-unique: RFC5929: Channel Bindings for TLS
      (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5929)
   *  tls-exporter: RFC9266: Channel Bindings for TLS 1.3
      (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9266)

   When a router receives a HELLO message from a client with a TLS
   channel binding attribute present, the router MUST:

   1.  get the TLS channel ID (32 bytes) of the TLS session with the
       respective channel type requested
   2.  generate new challenge (32 random bytes)
   3.  expect the client to send back a signature in AUTHENTICATE
       computed over challenge XOR channel_id

   and send back the channel_binding in use, and the challenge in a
   CHALLENGE message:

[4, 'cryptosign', {
  'challenge': '0e9192bc08512c8198da159c1ae600ba91729215f35d56102ee318558e773537',
  'channel_binding': 'tls-unique'}]

   The authenticating client MUST verify the actual channel binding in
   use matches the one it requested.  If a router does not support the
   channel_binding the client requested, it may chose to continue the
   authentication without channel binding, and hence CHALLENGE.Extra
   would not contain a channel_binding.

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-AP                  September 2025


   The client MUST then locally fetch the channel_id from the underlying
   TLS connection and sign CHALLENGE.Extra.challenge XOR channel_id
   using its private key.

5.4.3.  Router Authentication

   With the basic _Client Authentication_ mechanism in WAMP-Cryptosign,
   the router is able to authenticate the client, since to successfully
   sign CHALLENGE.Extra.challenge the client will need the private key
   corresponding to the public key which the client announced in
   HELLO.Details.pubkey to be authenticated under.

   However, from this alone, the client can not be sure the router
   against which it is authenticating is actually valid, as in
   authentic. _Router Authentication_ adds this capability.

   To request a router to authenticate, a client will start the
   authentication handshake by sending HELLO.Details.challenge|string:

[1, 'realm1', {
  'authextra': {
    'challenge': 'bbae60ea44cdd7b20dc7010a618b0f0803fab25a817520b4b7f057299b524deb',
    'pubkey': '545efb0a2192db8d43f118e9bf9aee081466e1ef36c708b96ee6f62dddad9122'
    }}]

   Similar to _Client Authentication_, the challenge must encode a 32
   bytes random value as a string in HEX format, and the router MUST
   respond by signing this challenge value with its (the router's)
   private key, and send back the signature in CHALLENGE.Extra.signature

[4, 'cryptosign', {
  'challenge': '0e9192bc08512c8198da159c1ae600ba91729215f35d56102ee318558e773537',
  'pubkey': '4a3838f6fe75251e613329d53fc69b262d5eac97fb1d73bebbaed4015b53c862',
  'signature': 'fd5128d2d207ba58a9d1d6f41b72c747964ad9d1294077b3b1eee6130b05843ab12c53c7f2519f73d4feb82db19d8ca0fc26b62bde6518e79a882f5795bc9f00bbae60ea44cdd7b20dc7010a618b0f0803fab25a817520b4b7f057299b524deb'}]

   When _Router Authentication_ is used, the router MUST also send its
   public key in CHALLENGE.Extra.pubkey.

   Further, _Router Authentication_ can be combined with _TLS Channel
   Binding_, in which case the value signed by the router will be
   HELLO.Details.challenge XOR channel_id.

5.4.4.  Trustroots and Certificates

5.4.4.1.  Certificate Chains

   A public-key certificate is a signed statement that is used to
   establish an association between an identity and a public key.  This
   is called a machine identity.  The entity that vouches for this
   association and signs the certificate is the issuer of the
   certificate and the identity whose public key is being vouched for is
   the subject of the certificate.  In order to associate the identity
   and the public key, a chain of certificates is used.  The certificate
   chain is also called the certification path or chain of trust.

   _What is a Certificate Chain?_

   A certificate chain is a list of certificates (usually starting with
   an end-entity certificate) followed by one or more CA certificates
   (usually the last one being a self-signed certificate), with the
   following properties:

   *  The *issuer* of each certificate (except the last one) matches the
      *subject of* the next certificate in the list.
   *  Each certificate (except the last one) is supposed to be signed by
      the secret key corresponding to the next certificate in the chain
      (i.e. the signature of one certificate can be verified using the
      public key contained in the following certificate).
   *  The last certificate in the list is a *trust anchor*: a
      certificate that you trust because it was delivered to you by some
      trustworthy procedure.  A trust anchor is a CA certificate (or
      more precisely, the public verification key of a CA) used by a
      relying party as the starting point for path validation.

   More information about certificate chains, while in the context of
   x509, can be found in this white paper published by the _PKI forum_:
   Understanding Certification Path Construction (http://www.oasis-
   pki.org/pdfs/Understanding_Path_construction-DS2.pdf).

   _What are On-chain Trust Anchors?_

   In x509, the set of trusted root CA certificates are stored in a
   machine/device local certificate store.  This set of trusted root CA
   certificates are:

   1.  filled and fixed by the software or device vendor with a default
       root CA certificates set
   2.  may be extendable or replaceable by a user provided custom root
       CA certificates set

   With 1., the user implicitly trusts the vendor, and all root CAs in
   the set installed by the vendor.  With 2., the user must manage a
   public-private key infrastructure, and when information is to be
   shared with other parties, the use PKI must be made available to
   those parties, and the parties will operationally and
   administratively depend on the PKI hosting party.  In summary, x509
   follows a centralized and hierarchical trust model.

   With WAMP-Cryptosign, we use a public blockchain for certificate
   chain trust anchors.  Using a public blockchain, specifically
   Ethereum, provides a decentralized, shared and cryptographically
   secure storage for root CA certificates, that is trust anchors.
   These anchors can be associated with other entities stored on-chain,
   such as _federated Realms_.

   The following diagram shows the structure of certificate chains in
   WAMP-Cryptosign:

   The EIP712 types for certificates contain:

   *  chainId: the chain ID of the blockchain this signed typed data is
      bound to
   *  verifyingContract: the address of the (main) smart contract this
      signed typed data is bound to

   This prevents cross-chain and cross-contract attacks.  The chainId is
   an integer according to EIP155
   (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-155.md):

   *  Ethereum Mainnet (ChainID 1)
   *  Goerli Testnet (ChainID 5)
   *  zkSync 2.0 Alpha Testnet (ChainID 280)

   Besides EIP712, other comparable approaches to specify
   cryptographically hashable, typed structured data ("messages")
   include:

   *  Veriform (https://docs.rs/veriform/latest/veriform/):
      cryptographically verifiable and canonicalized message format
      (https://github.com/iqlusioninc/veriform/blob/develop/spec/draft-
      veriform-spec.md) similar to Protocol Buffers, with an "embedded-
      first" (heapless) implementation suitable for certificates or
      other signed objects
   *  objecthash (https://github.com/benlaurie/objecthash): A way to
      cryptographically hash objects (in the JSON-ish sense) that works
      cross-language.  And, therefore, cross-encoding.

5.4.4.3.  Capabilities

   *  *Bit 0*: CAPABILITY_ROOT_CA
   *  *Bit 1*: CAPABILITY_INTERMEDIATE_CA
   *  *Bit 2*: CAPABILITY_PUBLIC_RELAY
   *  *Bit 3*: CAPABILITY_PRIVATE_RELAY
   *  *Bit 4*: CAPABILITY_GATEWAY
   *  *Bit 5*: CAPABILITY_EXCHANGE
   *  *Bit 6*: CAPABILITY_PROVIDER
   *  *Bit 7*: CAPABILITY_CONSUMER
   *  *Bits 8 - 63*: future use, all set to 0

   Permission to create a CAPABILITY_PUBLIC_RELAY certificate on a realm
   can be configured by the realm owner for:

   *  PRIVATE: signed by realm owner
   *  PERMISSIONED: signed by requestor and realm owner
   *  OPEN: signed by requestor

   Permission for CAPABILITY_ROOT_CA is always PRIVATE.

5.4.4.4.  Certificate Chain Verification

   use of a specific method/mechanism, when it comes to establishing
   trust (i.e. certifying public keys).

   To verify a certificate chain and respective certificate signatures

    (EIP712DelegateCertificate, Signature),       // delegate certificate
    (EIP712AuthorityCertificate, Signature),      // intermediate CA certificate
    ...
    (EIP712AuthorityCertificate, Signature),      // intermediate CA certificate
    (EIP712AuthorityCertificate, Signature)       // root CA certificate
]

   the following Certificate Chain Rules (CCR) must be checked:

   1.   *CCR-1*: The chainId and verifyingContract must match for all
        certificates to what we expect, and validFrom before current
        block number on the respective chain.
   2.   *CCR-2*: The realm must match for all certificates to the
        respective realm.
   3.   *CCR-3*: The type of the first certificate in the chain must be
        a EIP712DelegateCertificate, and all subsequent certificates
        must be of type EIP712AuthorityCertificate.
   4.   *CCR-4*: The last certificate must be self-signed (issuer equals
        subject), it is a root CA certificate.
   5.   *CCR-5*: The intermediate certificate's issuer must be equal to
        the subject of the previous certificate.
   6.   *CCR-6*: The root certificate must be validFrom before the
        intermediate certificate
   7.   *CCR-7*: The capabilities of intermediate certificate must be a
        subset of the root cert
   8.   *CCR-8*: The intermediate certificate's subject must be the
        delegate certificate delegate
   9.   *CCR-9*: The intermediate certificate must be validFrom before
        the delegate certificate
   10.  *CCR-10*: The root certificate's signature must be valid and
        signed by the root certificate's issuer.
   11.  *CCR-11*: The intermediate certificate's signature must be valid
        and signed by the intermediate certificate's issuer.
   12.  *CCR-12*: The delegate certificate's signature must be valid and
        signed by the delegate.

5.4.4.5.  Trustroots

   Certificate chains allow to verify a delegate certificate following
   the Issuers-Subjects up to a _Root CA_, which is a self-signed
   certificate (issuer and subject are identical).  The _Root CA_
   represents the _Trustroot_ of all involved delegates.

   When both a connecting WAMP client and the WAMP router are using the
   same _Root CA_ and thus use a common _Trustroot_, they are said to be
   authorized in the same trust domain (identified by the trustroot).

   Trustroots are identified by their Ethereum address, which is
   computed from the issuer public key according to EIP-55
   (https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/04keys-
   addresses.asciidoc#ethereum-addresses).

   There are two types of _Root CAs_ and _Trustroots_:

   1.  _Standalone Trustroot_
   2.  _On-chain Trustroot_

   A _Standalone Trustroot_ is managed by a single operator/owner, does
   not allow infrastructure elements (nodes, client, realms) to be
   integrated between different operators/owners and is privately stored
   on the respective operators systems only, usually as files or in
   databases.

   Note that the Ethereum _address_, can be _computed_ deterministically
   from the public key of the issuer of a certificate, even when the
   certificate (or the issuer) is _not_ stored on-chain.

   An _On-chain Trustroot_ in contrast is stored in Ethereum and
   publically shared between different operators/owners which allows
   infrastructure elements (nodes, clients, realms) to be integrated.
   For example, clients/nodes operated by different operators can
   authenticate to each other and nodes operated by different operators
   can authenticate to each other sharing the hosting of one realm.

   The management of _On-Chain Trustroots_ depends on the policy of the
   trustroot which is chosen and fixed when the trustroot is created:

   1.  _Open_
   2.  _Permitted_
   3.  _Private_

   With an _Open On-chain Trustroot_, new certificates can be added to a
   certificate chain freely and only requires a signature by the
   respective intermediate CA issuer.

5.4.4.5.1.  Standalone Trustroots

   For a _Standalone Trustroot_ the trustroot MUST be specified in
   HELLO.Details.authextra.trustroot|string

{'authextra': {'certificates': [/* certificate, see below */],
              'challenge': '2763e7fdb1c34a74e8497daf6c913744d11161a94cec3b16aeec60a788612e17',

   and certificates MUST contain

   *  a single EIP712DelegateCertificate, and have the complete
      certificate chain of EIP712AuthorityCertificates up to trustroot
      pre-agreed (locally stored or built-in) OR
   *  the complete chain of certificates starting with a
      EIP712DelegateCertificate followed by one or more
      EIP712AuthorityCertificates up to trustroot.

   Example 3 (#message-exchange-example3) contains an example gor the
   latter, with a bundled complete certificate chain, that is the last
   certificate in the list is self-signed (is a root CA certificate) and
   matches trustroot

   trustroot == 0xf766Dc789CF04CD18aE75af2c5fAf2DA6650Ff57
             == certificates[-1].issuer
             == certificates[-1].subject

5.4.4.5.2.  On-chain Trustroots

   For an _On-chain Trustroot_ the trustroot MUST be specified in
   HELLO.Details.authextra.trustroot|string

{'authextra': {'certificates': [/* certificate, see below */],
              'challenge': '2763e7fdb1c34a74e8497daf6c913744d11161a94cec3b16aeec60a788612e17',

              'trustroot': '0xf766Dc789CF04CD18aE75af2c5fAf2DA6650Ff57'},

   and certificates MUST contain a single EIP712DelegateCertificate, and
   have the complete certificate chain of EIP712AuthorityCertificates up
   to trustroot stored on-chain (Ethereum).

   This is called a free-standing, on-chain CA.

   When the trustroot is associated with an on-chain _Realm_ that has
   trustroot configured as the _Realm CA_, this is called _On-chain CA
   with CA associated with On-chain Realm_.

5.4.5.  Remote Attestation

   Remote attestation is a method by which a host (WAMP client)
   authenticates its hardware and software configuration to a remote
   host (WAMP router).  The goal of remote attestation is to enable a
   remote system (challenger) to determine the level of trust in the
   integrity of the platform of another system (attestator).

   Remote attestation allows to

   *  perform security decisions based on security policy and
      measurement log
   *  tie device identity into authentication infrastructure
   *  verify device state in access control decisions
   *  avoid exfiltration of credentials

   Remote attestation is requested by the router sending
   CHALLENGE.extra.attest|list[int] with a list of device PCRs to be
   quoted.  A list of all PCRs available (usually 24) in a PCR bank of a
   device can be obtained running tpm2_pcrread (https://tpm2-
   tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man/tpm2_pcrread.1/#display-all-pcr-
   values) without arguments.

   A client receiving such a CHALLENGE MUST include an _Event Log_ with
   PCRs collected from _measured boot_ signed by the device's security
   module's _Attestation Key (AK)_ and using the challenge sent by the
   router CHALLENGE.extra.challenge|string as a nonce.  TPM 2.0
   (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module) of the TCG
   (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Computing_Group) specifies a
   suitable function in tss2_quote (https://tpm2-
   tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man/tss2_quote.1/) (also see here
   (https://tpm2-tss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
   group___fapi___quote.html)).

   The client MUST include the signed attestation in
   AUTHENTICATE.Extra.quote and the corresponding measurement log in
   AUTHENTICATE.Extra.measurement.  The following diagram illustrates
   _Remote Attestation_ with WAMP-Cryptosign:

5.5.  Dynamic Authentication API

   Write me.

5.6.  Authorization

   WAMP allows user services to integrate seamlessly while enabling
   _Clients_ to perform _Actions_, namely, to

   *  *register* procedures using fully qualified URIs or URI patterns
      in order to receive invocations
   *  *call* procedures at (fully qualified) URIs
   *  *subscribe* to topics using fully qualified URIs or URI patterns
      in order to receive events
   *  *publish* events to (fully qualified) URIs

   Performing these actions requires _Clients_ to have an open _Session_
   to the same shared _Realm_.

   A _Session_ is established between a _Client_ to a _Router_, and is
   initiated by a _Client_.

   _Sessions_ MAY be required to _Authenticate_ access to a _Realm_
   hosted by a _Router_.

   _Authentication_ is the sequence of operations that allow a _Router_
   to verify the identity of a _Session_, often as a prerequisite to
   allowing access to resources within a _Realm_.

   When the _Session_ authenticates to a _Router_ successfully, the
   _Router_ will have established the

   *  realm|string,
   *  authrole|string, and
   *  authid|string

   for that _Session_ running in the _Client_.

   The triple (realm, authrole, authid) is called _Principal_, and a
   _Session_ is authenticated under that _Principal_.

   At any moment, there can be zero, one, or many _Sessions_ with
   different _session ids_ authenticated under the _same_ _Principal_.

   _Sessions_ MAY be required to _Authorize_ in order to perform a
   specific _Action_ on an URI - or an URI pattern - within a _Realm_.

   This distinction between _Authentication_ and _Authorization_ follows
   the established practice called "AAA":

   *  *A*uthentication: Establishes who it is (*"subject"*)
   *  *A*uthorization: Decides within a _Realm_ whether an _Action_
      (*"operation"*) on an URI or URI pattern (*"object"*) is allowed
      for the requesting _Principal_ (*"subject"*)
   *  *A*ccounting: Records, for a _Realm_, what _Action_
      (*"operation"*) on what URI or URI pattern (*"object"*) was
      requested by which _Principal_ (*"subject"*), and whether it was
      allowed or denied

6.  Advanced Security Features

   This section covers some advanced features and techniques provided by
   WAMP mainly but not limited to security and cryptography.

6.1.  Payload Passthru Mode

   In some situations, you may want to reduce the access the router has
   to the information users transmit, or payload data is presented in
   some specific format that can not be simply recognized by WAMP router
   serializer.



Oberstein                 Expires 28 March 2026               [Page 136]

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-AP                  September 2025


   Here are some use cases:

   *  Using WAMP via gateways to other technologies like MQTT Brokers or
      AMQP Queues.  So the actual payload is, for example, MQTT message
      that should be delivered to a WAMP topic as is.
   *  Sensitive user data that should be delivered to a target _Callee_
      without any possibility of unveiling it in transit.

   The above use cases can be fulfilled with the Payload Passthru Mode
   feature.  This feature allows:

   *  Specifying additional attributes within CALL, PUBLISH, EVENT,
      YIELD, RESULT messages to signal the _Router_ to skip payload
      inspection/conversion.
   *  The forwarding of these additional attributes via INVOCATION and
      ERROR messages
   *  Encrypting and decrypting payload using cryptographic algorithms.
   *  Providing additional information about payload format and type.

   *Feature Announcement*

   Support for this advanced feature MUST be announced by _Callers_
   (role := "caller"), _Callees_ (role := "callee"), _Dealers_ (role :=
   "dealer"), _Publishers_ (role := "publisher"), _Subscribers_ (role :=
   "subscriber") and _Brokers_ (role := "broker") via

   HELLO.Details.roles.<role>.features.payload_passthru_mode|bool :=
   true

   Payload Passthru Mode can work only if all three nodes (_Caller_,
   _Dealer_, _Callee_ or _Publisher_, _Broker_, _Subscriber_) support
   and announced this feature.

   Cases where a _Caller_ sends a CALL message with payload passthru
   without announcing it during the HELLO handshake MUST be treated as
   _PROTOCOL ERRORS_ and underlying WAMP connections must be aborted
   with the wamp.error.protocol_violation error reason.

   Cases where a _Caller_ sends a CALL message with payload passthru to
   a _Dealer_, the latter not announcing payload passthru support during
   WELCOME handshake MUST be treated as _PROTOCOL ERRORS_ and the
   underlying WAMP connections must be aborted with the
   wamp.error.protocol_violation error reason.

   Cases where a _Caller_ sends a CALL message with payload passthru to
   a _Dealer_ that supports this feature, which then must be routed to a
   _Callee_ which doesn't support payload passthru, MUST be treated as
   _APPLICATION ERRORS_ and the _Dealer_ MUST respond to the _Caller_
   with a wamp.error.feature_not_supported error message.

   Cases where a _Publisher_ sends a PUBLISH message with payload
   passthru, without announcing it during HELLO handshake, MUST be
   treated as _PROTOCOL ERRORS_ and the underlying WAMP connections must
   be aborted with the wamp.error.protocol_violation error reason.

   Cases where a _Publisher_ sends a PUBLISH message with payload
   passthru to a _Broker_, with the latter not announcing payload
   passthru support during the WELCOME handshake, MUST be treated as
   _PROTOCOL ERRORS_ and the underlying WAMP connections must be aborted
   with the wamp.error.protocol_violation error reason.

   Cases where a _Publisher_ sends a PUBLISH message with payload
   passthru to a _Broker_ that supports this feature, which then must be
   routed to a _Subscriber_ which doesn't support payload passthru,
   cannot be recognized at the protocol level due to asynchronous
   message processing and must be covered at the _Subscriber_ side.

   Cases where a _Callee_ sends a YIELD message with payload passthru
   without announcing it during the HELLO handshake MUST be treated as
   _PROTOCOL ERRORS_ and the underlying WAMP connections must be aborted
   with the wamp.error.protocol_violation error reason.

   Cases where a _Callee_ sends a YIELD message with payload passthru to
   a _Dealer_, with the latter not announcing payload passthru support
   during the WELCOME handshake, MUST be treated as _PROTOCOL ERRORS_
   and the underlying WAMP connections must be aborted with the
   wamp.error.protocol_violation error reason.

   Cases where a _Callee_ sends a YIELD message with payload passthru to
   a _Dealer_ that supports this feature, which then must be routed to
   the _Caller_ which doesn't support payload passthru, MUST be treated
   as _APPLICATION ERRORS_ and the _Dealer_ MUST respond to the _Callee_
   with a wamp.error.feature_not_supported error message.

   *Message Attributes*

   To use payload passthru mode, the options for CALL, PUBLISH and YIELD
   messages MUST be extended with additional attributes.  These
   additional attributes must be forwarded via INVOCATION, EVENT and
   RESULT messages, respectively, as well as ERROR messages in the case
   of failures.

   ppt_* attributes to obtain information about encryption keys.  For
   gateways and external schemas this can contain the name of related

   technology.  The one predefined is mqtt.  Others may be introduced
   later.  A _Router_ can recognize that Payload Passthru Mode is in use
   by checking the existence and non-empty value of this attribute
   within the options of CALL, PUBLISH and YIELD messages.

   *ppt_serializer Attribute*

   The ppt_serializer attribute is optional.  It specifies what
   serializer was used to encode the payload.  It can be a native value
   to indicate that the incoming data is tunneling through other
   technologies specified by the ppt_scheme, or it can be ordinary json,
   msgpack, cbor, flatbuffers data serializers.  For some predefined
   ppt_scheme schemas this option may be omitted as schema defines the
   concrete serializer.  See predefined schemas below.

   *ppt_cipher Attribute*

   The ppt_cipher attribute is optional.  It is required if the payload
   is encrypted.  This attribute specifies the cryptographic algorithm
   that was used to encrypt the payload.  It can be xsalsa20poly1305,
   aes256gcm for now.

   *ppt_keyid Attribute*

   The ppt_keyid attribute is optional.  This attribute can contain the
   encryption key id that was used to encrypt the payload.  The
   ppt_keyid attribute is a string type.  The value can be a hex-encoded
   string, URI, DNS name, Ethereum address, UUID identifier - any
   meaningful value which allows the target peer to choose a private key
   without guessing.  The format of the value may depend on the
   ppt_scheme attribute.

                    Table 15

   When Payload Passthru Mode is used for gateways to other
   technologies, such as MQTT Brokers, then the ppt_serializer attribute
   may be set to the native value.  This means that the payload is not
   to be modified by WAMP peers, nor serialized in any manner, and is
   delivered as-is from the originating peer.  Another possible case is
   when the ppt_serializer attribute is set to any valid serializer, for
   example msgpack.  In this case the originating WAMP client peer first
   applies ppt_serializer to serialize the payload (without encryption),
   then the resulting binary payload is embedded in the WAMP message,
   the latter having possibly a different serializer depending on the
   one chosen during WAMP Session establishment.

   *Important Note Regarding JSON Serialization*

   With Payload Passthru Mode, payloads are treated as binary.  To send
   these binary payloads, the WAMP session serializer MUST support byte
   arrays.  Most serialization formats known to WAMP support byte
   arrays, but JSON does not support them natively.  To use Payload
   Passthru Mode with a JSON serializer, WAMP peers MUST perform the
   special Binary serialization in JSON (#binary-support-in-json).  This
   conversion may have unacceptable overhead, so it is generally advised
   to use WAMP session serializers with native byte array support, for
   example, MessagePack, CBOR, or FlatBuffers.

   *Message Structure*

   When Payload Passthru Mode is in use, the message payload MUST be
   sent as one binary item within Arguments|list, while ArgumentsKw|dict
   MUST be absent or empty.

   Since many WAMP messages assume the possibility of simultaneous use
   of Arguments|list and ArgumentsKw|dict, WAMP client implementations
   must package arguments into the following hash table and then
   serialize it and transmit as a single element within Arguments|list.

   This will allow maintaining a single interface for client

   *About Supported Serializers and Cryptographic Ciphers*

   WAMP serves as infrastructure for delivering messages between peers.
   Regardless of what encryption algorithm and serializer were chosen
   for Payload Passthru Mode, a _Router_ shall not inspect and analyze
   the ppt_ options and payload of encrypted messages.  The application
   is responsible for choosing serializers and ciphers known to every
   peer involved in message processing.

6.2.  Payload End-to-End Encryption

   TBD

7.  Advanced Transports and Serializers

   The only requirements that WAMP expects from a transport are: the
   transport must be message-based, bidirectional, reliable and ordered.
   This allows WAMP to run over different transports without any impact
   at the application layer.

   Besides the WebSocket transport, the following WAMP transports are
   currently specified:

   *  RawSocket Transport (#rawsocket)
   *  Batched WebSocket Transport (#batchedwebsocket)
   *  LongPoll Transport (#longpoll)
   *  Multiplexed Transport (#multiplexed)

   |  Other transports such as HTTP 2.0 ("SPDY") or UDP might be defined
   |  in the future.

7.1.  RawSocket Transport

   *WAMP-over-RawSocket* is an (alternative) transport for WAMP that
   uses length-prefixed, binary messages - a message framing different
   from WebSocket.

   Compared to WAMP-over-WebSocket, WAMP-over-RawSocket is simple to
   implement, since there is no need to implement the WebSocket protocol
   which has some features that make it non-trivial (like a full HTTP-
   based opening handshake, message fragmentation, masking and variable
   length integers).

   WAMP-over-RawSocket has even lower overhead than WebSocket, which can
   be desirable in particular when running on local connections like
   loopback TCP or Unix domain sockets.  It is also expected to allow
   implementations in microcontrollers in under 2KB RAM.

   WAMP-over-RawSocket can run over TCP, TLS, Unix domain sockets or any
   reliable streaming underlying transport.  When run over TLS on the
   standard port for secure HTTPS (443), it is also able to traverse
   most locked down networking environments such as enterprise or mobile
   networks (unless man-in-the-middle TLS intercepting proxies are in
   use).

   However, WAMP-over-RawSocket cannot be used with Web browser clients,
   since browsers do not allow raw TCP connections.  Browser extensions
   would do, but those need to be installed in a browser.  WAMP-over-
   RawSocket also (currently) does not support transport-level
   compression as WebSocket does provide (permessage-deflate WebSocket
   extension).

   *Endianess*

   WAMP-over-RawSocket uses _network byte order_ ("big-endian").  That
   means, given a unsigned 32 bit integer

       0x 11 22 33 44

   the first octet sent out to (or received from) the wire is 0x11 and
   the last octet sent out (or received) is 0x44.

   Here is how you would convert octets received from the wire into an
   integer in Python:

   import struct

   octets_received = b"\x11\x22\x33\x44"
   i = struct.unpack(">L", octets_received)[0]

   The integer received has the value 287454020.

   And here is how you would send out an integer to the wire in Python:

   octets_to_be_send = struct.pack(">L", i)

   The octets to be sent are b"\x11\x22\x33\x44".

   *Handshake: Client-to-Router Request*

   WAMP-over-RawSocket starts with a handshake where the client
   connecting to a router sends 4 octets:

       MSB                                 LSB
       31                                    0
       0111 1111 LLLL SSSS RRRR RRRR RRRR RRRR

   The _first octet_ is a magic octet with value 0x7F.  This value is
   chosen to avoid any possible collision with the first octet of a
   valid HTTP request (see here (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/
   rfc2616-sec5.html#sec5.1) and here
   (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec2.html#sec2.2)).  No
   valid HTTP request can have 0x7F as its first octet.

   |  By using a magic first octet that cannot appear in a regular HTTP
   |  request, WAMP-over-RawSocket can be run e.g. on the same TCP
   |  listening port as WAMP-over-WebSocket or WAMP-over-LongPoll.

   The _second octet_ consists of a 4 bit LENGTH field and a 4 bit
   SERIALIZER field.

   The LENGTH value is used by the _Client_ to signal the *maximum
   message length* of messages it is willing to *receive*. When the
   handshake completes successfully, a _Router_ MUST NOT send messages
   larger than this size.

   The possible values for LENGTH are:

        0: 2**9 octets
        1: 2**10 octets
       ...
       14: 2**23 octets
       15: 2**24 octets

   This means a _Client_ can choose the maximum message length between
   *512* and *16M* octets.

   The SERIALIZER value is used by the _Client_ to request a specific
   serializer to be used.  When the handshake completes successfully,
   the _Client_ and _Router_ will use the serializer requested by the
   _Client_.

   The possible values for SERIALIZER are:

       0: illegal
       1: JSON
       2: MessagePack
       3: CBOR
       4: UBJSON
       5: FlatBuffers
       6 - 15: reserved for future serializers

   Here is a Python program that prints all (currently) permissible
   values for the _second octet_:

   SERMAP = {
       1: 'json',
       2: 'msgpack',
       3: 'cbor',
       4: 'ubjson',
       5: 'flatbuffers',
   }

   # map serializer / max. msg length to RawSocket handshake
   # request or success reply (2nd octet)
   for ser in SERMAP:
       for l in range(16):
           octet_2 = (l << 4) | ser
           print("serializer: {}, maxlen: {} => 0x{:02x}".format(SERMAP[ser], 2 ** (l + 9), octet_2))

   The _third and forth octet_ are *reserved* and MUST be all zeros for
   now.

   *Handshake: Router-to-Client Reply*

   After a _Client_ has connected to a _Router_, the _Router_ will first
   receive the 4 octets handshake request from the _Client_.

   If the _first octet_ differs from 0x7F, it is not a WAMP-over-
   RawSocket request.  Unless the _Router_ also supports other
   transports on the connecting port (such as WebSocket or LongPoll),
   the _Router_ MUST *fail the connection*.

   Here is an example of how a _Router_ could parse the _second octet_
   in a _Clients_ handshake request:

   # map RawSocket handshake request (2nd octet) to
   # serializer / max. msg length
   for i in range(256):
       ser_id = i & 0x0f
       if ser_id != 0:
           ser = SERMAP.get(ser_id, 'currently undefined')
           maxlen = 2 ** ((i >> 4) + 9)
           print("{:02x} => serializer: {}, maxlen: {}".format(i, ser, maxlen))
       else:
           print("fail the connection: illegal serializer value")

   When the _Router_ is willing to speak the serializer requested by the
   _Client_, it will answer with a 4 octets response of identical
   structure as the _Client_ request:

       MSB                                 LSB
       31                                    0
       0111 1111 LLLL SSSS RRRR RRRR RRRR RRRR

   Again, the _first octet_ MUST be the value 0x7F.  The _third and
   forth octets_ are reserved and MUST be all zeros for now.

   In the _second octet_, the _Router_ MUST echo the serializer value in
   SERIALIZER as requested by the _Client_.

   Similar to the _Client_, the _Router_ sets the LENGTH field to
   request a limit on the length of messages sent by the _Client_.

   During the connection, _Router_ MUST NOT send messages to the
   _Client_ longer than the LENGTH requested by the _Client_, and the
   _Client_ MUST NOT send messages larger than the maximum requested by
   the _Router_ in its handshake reply.

   If a message received during a connection exceeds the limit
   requested, a _Peer_ MUST *fail the connection*.

   When the _Router_ is unable to speak the serializer requested by the
   _Client_, or it is denying the _Client_ for other reasons, the
   _Router_ replies with an error:

       MSB                                 LSB
       31                                    0
       0111 1111 EEEE 0000 RRRR RRRR RRRR RRRR

   An error reply has 4 octets: the _first octet_ is again the magic
   0x7F, and the _third and forth octet_ are reserved and MUST all be
   zeros for now.

   The _second octet_ has its lower 4 bits zero'ed (which distinguishes
   the reply from an success/accepting reply) and the upper 4 bits
   encode the error:

       0: illegal (must not be used)
       1: serializer unsupported
       2: maximum message length unacceptable
       3: use of reserved bits (unsupported feature)
       4: maximum connection count reached
       5 - 15: reserved for future errors

   |  Note that the error code 0 MUST NOT be used.  This is to allow
   |  storage of error state in a host language variable, while allowing
   |  0 to signal the current state "no error"

   Here is an example of how a _Router_ might create the _second octet_
   in an error response:

   ERRMAP = {
       0: "illegal (must not be used)",
       1: "serializer unsupported",
       2: "maximum message length unacceptable",
       3: "use of reserved bits (unsupported feature)",
       4: "maximum connection count reached"
   }

   # map error to RawSocket handshake error reply (2nd octet)
   for err in ERRMAP:
       octet_2 = err << 4
       print("error: {} => 0x{:02x}").format(ERRMAP[err], err)

   The _Client_ - after having sent its handshake request - will wait
   for the 4 octets from _Router_ handshake reply.

   Here is an example of how a _Client_ might parse the _second octet_
   in a _Router_ handshake reply:

   for i in range(256):
       ser_id = i & 0x0f
       if ser_id:
           # verify the serializer is the one we requested!
           # if not, fail the connection!
           ser = SERMAP.get(ser_id, 'currently undefined')
           maxlen = 2 ** ((i >> 4) + 9)
           print("{:02x} => serializer: {}, maxlen: {}".format(i, ser, maxlen))
       else:
           err = i >> 4
           print("error: {}".format(ERRMAP.get(err, 'currently undefined')))

   *Serialization*

   To send a WAMP message, the message is serialized according to the
   WAMP serializer agreed in the handshake (e.g. JSON, MessagePack,
   CBOR, UBJSON or FlatBuffers).

   The length of the serialized messages in octets MUST NOT exceed the
   maximum requested by the _Peer_.

   If the serialized length exceed the maximum requested, the WAMP
   message can not be sent to the _Peer_. Handling situations like the
   latter is left to the implementation.

   E.g. a _Router_ that is to forward a WAMP EVENT to a _Client_ which
   exceeds the maximum length requested by the _Client_ when serialized
   might:

   *  drop the event (not forwarding to that specific client) and track
      dropped events
   *  prohibit publishing to the topic already
   *  remove the event payload, and send an event with extra information
      (payload_limit_exceeded = true)

   *Framing*

   The serialized octets for a message to be sent are prefixed with
   exactly 4 octets.

       MSB                                 LSB
       31                                    0
       RRRR XTTT LLLL LLLL LLLL LLLL LLLL LLLL

   The _three least significant octets_ constitute an unsigned 24 bit
   integer that provides the length of transport message payload
   following, excluding the 4 octets that constitute the prefix.

   The four bits RRRR are reserved for future use and MUST be all zeros
   for now.

   X is an extra (25th) bit used to encode the message payload length.
   This bit is only set when the payload length is exactly 16M octets,
   with the 24 remaining L bits cleared:

       MSB                                 LSB
       31                                    0
       RRRR 1TTT 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000

   When the payload length is 16M-1 octets, for example, the prefix
   would be:

       MSB                                 LSB
       31                                    0
       RRRR 0TTT 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111

   The three bits TTT encode the type of the transport message:

       0: regular WAMP message
       1: PING
       2: PONG
       3-7: reserved

   For a regular WAMP message (TTT == 0), the length is the length of
   the serialized WAMP message: the number of octets after serialization
   (excluding the 4 octets of the prefix).

   For a PING message (TTT == 1), the length is the length of the
   arbitrary payload that follows.  A _Peer_ MUST reply to each PING by
   sending exactly one PONG immediately, and the PONG MUST echo back the
   payload of the PING exactly.

   For receiving messages with WAMP-over-RawSocket, a _Peer_ will
   usually read exactly 4 octets from the incoming stream, decode the
   transport level message type and payload length, and then receive as
   many octets as the length was giving.

   When the transport level message type indicates a regular WAMP
   message, the transport level message payload is unserialized
   according to the serializer agreed in the handshake and the processed
   at the WAMP level.

7.2.  Message Batching

   _WAMP-over-Batched-WebSocket_ is a variant of WAMP-over-WebSocket
   where multiple WAMP messages are sent in one WebSocket message.

   Using WAMP message batching can increase wire level efficiency
   further.  In particular when using TLS and the WebSocket
   implementation is forcing every WebSocket message into a new TLS
   segment.

   WAMP-over-Batched-WebSocket is negotiated between Peers in the
   WebSocket opening handshake by agreeing on one of the following
   WebSocket subprotocols:

   *  wamp.2.json.batched
   *  wamp.2.msgpack.batched
   *  wamp.2.cbor.batched

   Batching with JSON works by serializing each WAMP message to JSON as
   normally, appending the single ASCII control character \30 (record
   separator (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
   Record_separator#Field_separators)) octet 0x1e to _each_ serialized
   messages, and packing a sequence of such serialized messages into a
   single WebSocket message:

       Serialized JSON WAMP Msg 1 | 0x1e |
           Serialized JSON WAMP Msg 2 | 0x1e | ...

   Batching with MessagePack works by serializing each WAMP message to
   MessagePack as normally, prepending a 32 bit unsigned integer (4
   octets in big-endian byte order) with the length of the serialized
   MessagePack message (excluding the 4 octets for the length prefix),
   and packing a sequence of such serialized (length-prefixed) messages
   into a single WebSocket message:

       Length of Msg 1 serialization (uint32) |
           serialized MessagePack WAMP Msg 1 | ...

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-AP                  September 2025


   With batched transport, even if only a single WAMP message is to be
   sent in a WebSocket message, the (single) WAMP message needs to be
   framed as described above.  In other words, a single WAMP message is
   sent as a batch of length *1*. Sending a batch of length *0* (no WAMP
   message) is illegal and a _Peer_ MUST fail the transport upon
   receiving such a transport message.

7.3.  HTTP Longpoll Transport

   The _Long-Poll Transport_ is able to transmit a WAMP session over
   plain old HTTP 1.0/1.1.  This is realized by the Client issuing HTTP/
   POSTs requests, one for sending, and one for receiving.  Those latter
   requests are kept open at the server when there are no messages
   currently pending to be received.

   *Opening a Session*

   With the Long-Poll Transport, a Client opens a new WAMP session by
   sending a HTTP/POST request to a well-known URL, e.g.

       http://mypp.com/longpoll/open

   Here, http://mypp.com/longpoll is the base URL for the Long-Poll
   Transport and /open is a path dedicated for opening new sessions.

   The HTTP/POST request SHOULD have a Content-Type header set to
   application/json and MUST have a request body with a JSON document
   that is a dictionary:

       {
          "protocols": ["wamp.2.json"]
       }

   The (mandatory) protocols attribute specifies the protocols the
   client is willing to speak.  The server will chose one from this list
   when establishing the session or fail the request when no protocol
   overlap was found.

   The valid protocols are:

   *  wamp.2.json.batched
   *  wamp.2.json
   *  wamp.2.msgpack.batched
   *  wamp.2.msgpack
   *  wamp.2.cbor.batched
   *  wamp.2.cbor

   |  The request path with this and subsequently described HTTP/POST
   |  requests MAY contain a query parameter x with some random or
   |  sequentially incremented value:
   |  
   |  http://mypp.com/longpoll/open?x=382913 (http://mypp.com/longpoll/
   |  open?x=382913)
   |  
   |  The value is ignored, but may help in certain situations to
   |  prevent intermediaries from caching the request.

   Returned is a JSON document containing a transport ID and the
   protocol to speak:

       {
          "protocol": "wamp.2.json",
          "transport": "kjmd3sBLOUnb3Fyr"
       }

   As an implied side-effect, two HTTP endpoints are created

       http://mypp.com/longpoll/<transport_id>/receive
       http://mypp.com/longpoll/<transport_id>/send

   where transport_id is the transport ID returned from open, e.g.

       http://mypp.com/longpoll/kjmd3sBLOUnb3Fyr/receive
       http://mypp.com/longpoll/kjmd3sBLOUnb3Fyr/send

   *Receiving WAMP Messages*

   The Client will then issue HTTP/POST requests (with empty request
   body) to

       http://mypp.com/longpoll/kjmd3sBLOUnb3Fyr/receive

   When there are WAMP messages pending downstream, a request will
   return with a single WAMP message (unbatched modes) or a batch of
   serialized WAMP messages (batched mode).

   The serialization format used is the one agreed during opening the
   session.

   The batching uses the same scheme as with wamp.2.json.batched and
   wamp.2.msgpack.batched transport over WebSocket.

   |  Note: In unbatched mode, when there is more than one message
   |  pending, there will be at most one message returned for each
   |  request.  The other pending messages must be retrieved by new
   |  requests.  With batched mode, all messages pending at request time
   |  will be returned in one batch of messages.

   *Sending WAMP Messages*

   For sending WAMP messages, the _Client_ will issue HTTP/POST requests
   to

       http://mypp.com/longpoll/kjmd3sBLOUnb3Fyr/send

   with request body being a single WAMP message (unbatched modes) or a
   batch of serialized WAMP messages (batched mode).

   The serialization format used is the one agreed during opening the
   session.

   The batching uses the same scheme as with wamp.2.json.batched and
   wamp.2.msgpack.batched transport over WebSocket.

   Upon success, the request will return with HTTP status code 202 ("no
   content").  Upon error, the request will return with HTTP status code
   400 ("bad request").

   *Closing a Session*

   To orderly close a session, a Client will issue a HTTP/POST to

       http://mypp.com/longpoll/kjmd3sBLOUnb3Fyr/close

   with an empty request body.  Upon success, the request will return
   with HTTP status code 202 ("no content").

7.4.  Binary support in JSON

   Binary data follows a convention for conversion to JSON strings.

   A byte array is converted to a JSON string as follows:

   1.  convert the byte array to a Base64 encoded (host language) string
   2.  prepend the string with a \0 character
   3.  serialize the string to a JSON string

   where Base64 encoding follows Section 4 of [RFC4648].

   _Example_



Oberstein                 Expires 28 March 2026               [Page 158]

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-AP                  September 2025


   Consider the byte array (hex representation):

       10e3ff9053075c526f5fc06d4fe37cdb

   This will get converted to Base64

       EOP/kFMHXFJvX8BtT+N82w==

   prepended with \0

       \x00EOP/kFMHXFJvX8BtT+N82w==

   and serialized to a JSON string

       "\\u0000EOP/kFMHXFJvX8BtT+N82w=="

   A JSON string is unserialized to either a string or a byte array
   using the following procedure:

   1.  Unserialize a JSON string to a host language (Unicode) string
   2.  If the string starts with a \0 character, interpret the rest
       (after the first character) as Base64 and decode to a byte array
   3.  Otherwise, return the Unicode string

   Below are complete Python and JavaScript code examples for conversion
   between byte arrays and JSON strings.

   data_in = os.urandom(16)

   }

   var encoded = JSON.stringify("\0" + window.btoa(raw_out));

   // unserialize from JSON
   var decoded = JSON.parse(encoded);

   var data_out;
   if (decoded.charCodeAt(0) === 0) {
      // strip first character and decode base64 to raw string
      var raw = window.atob(decoded.substring(1));

      // convert raw string to byte array
      var data_out = new Uint8Array(new ArrayBuffer(raw.length));
      for (var i = 0; i < raw.length; ++i) {
         data_out[i] = raw.charCodeAt(i);
      }
   } else {
      data_out = decoded;
   }

   console.log(data_out);

7.5.  Multiplexed Transport

   A Transport may support the multiplexing of multiple logical
   transports over a single "physical" transport.

   By using such a Transport, multiple WAMP sessions can be transported
   over a single underlying transport at the same time.






Oberstein                 Expires 28 March 2026               [Page 161]

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-AP                  September 2025


   As an example, the proposed WebSocket extension "permessage-priority"
   (https://github.com/oberstet/permessage-priority/blob/master/draft-
   oberstein-hybi-permessage-priority.txt) would allow creating multiple
   logical Transports for WAMP over a single underlying WebSocket
   connection.

   Sessions running over a multiplexed Transport are completely
   independent: they get assigned different session IDs, may join
   different realms and each session needs to authenticate itself.

   Because of above, Multiplexed Transports for WAMP are actually not
   detailed in the WAMP spec, but a feature of the transport being used.

   |  Note: Currently no WAMP transport supports multiplexing.  The work
   |  on the MUX extension with WebSocket has stalled, and the
   |  permessage-priority proposal above is still just a proposal.
   |  However, with RawSocket, we should be able to add multiplexing in
   |  the the future (with downward compatibility).

8.  WAMP Interfaces

   WAMP was designed with the goals of being easy to approach and use
   for application developers.  Creating a procedure to expose some
   custom functionality should be possible in any supported programming
   language using that language's native elements, with the least amount
   of additional effort.

   Following from that, WAMP uses _dynamic typing_ for the application
   payloads of calls, call results and error, as well as event payloads.

   A WAMP router will happily forward _any_ application payload on _any_
   procedure or topic URI as long as the client is _authorized_ (has
   permission) to execute the respective WAMP action (call, register,
   publish or subscribe) on the given URI.

   This approach has served WAMP well, as application developers can get
   started immediately, and evolve and change payloads as they need
   without extra steps.  These advantages in flexibility of course come
   at a price, as nothing is free, and knowing that price is important
   to be aware of the tradeoffs one is accepting when using dynamic
   typing:

   *  problematic coordination of _Interfaces_ within larger developer
      teams or between different parties
   *  no easy way to stabilize, freeze, document or share _Interfaces_
   *  no way to programmatically describe _Interfaces_ ("interface
      reflection") at run-time

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-AP                  September 2025


   Problems such above could be avoided when WAMP supported an _option_
   to formally define WAMP-based _Interfaces_. This needs to answer the
   following questions:

   1.  How to specify the args|List and kwargs|Dict application payloads
       that are used in WAMP calls, errors and events?
   2.  How to specify the type and URI (patterns) for WAMP RPCs
       _Procedures_ and WAMP PubSub _Topics_ that make up an
       _Interface_, and how to identify an _Interface_ itself as a
       collection of _Procedures_ and _Topics_?
   3.  How to package, publish and share _Catalogs_ as a collection of
       _Interfaces_ plus metadata

   The following sections will describe the solution to each of above
   questions using WAMP IDL.

   Using WAMP Interfaces finally allows to support the following
   application developer level features:

   1.  router-based application payload validation and enforcement
   2.  WAMP interface documentation generation and autodocs Web service
   3.  publication and sharing of WAMP Interfaces and Catalogs
   4.  client binding code generation from WAMP Interfaces
   5.  run-time WAMP type reflection as part of the WAMP meta API

8.1.  WAMP IDL

8.1.1.  Application Payload Typing

   To define the application payload Arguments|list and
   ArgumentsKw|dict, WAMP IDL reuses the FlatBuffers IDL
   (https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/md__schemas.html),
   specifically, we map a pair of Arguments|list and ArgumentsKw|dict to
   a FlatBuffers Table with WAMP defined FlatBuffers _Attributes_.

   User defined WAMP application payloads are transmitted in
   Arguments|list and ArgumentsKw|dict elements of the following WAMP
   messages:

   *  PUBLISH
   *  EVENT
   *  CALL
   *  INVOCATION
   *  YIELD
   *  RESULT
   *  ERROR

   A _Publisher_ uses the

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-AP                  September 2025


   *  PUBLISH.Arguments|list and PUBLISH.ArgumentsKw|dict

   message elements to send the event payload to be published to the
   _Broker_ in PUBLISH messages.  When the event is accepted by the
   _Broker_, it will dispatch an EVENT message with

   *  EVENT.Arguments|list and EVENT.ArgumentsKw|dict

   message elements to all (eligible, and not excluded) _Subscribers_.

   A _Caller_ uses the

   *  CALL.Arguments|list and CALL.ArgumentsKw|dict

   message elements to send the call arguments to be used to the
   _Dealer_ in CALL messages.  When the call is accepted by the
   _Dealer_, it will forward

   *  INVOCATION.Arguments|list and INVOCATION.ArgumentsKw|dict

   to the (or one of) _Callee_, and receive YIELD messages with

   *  YIELD.Arguments|list and YIELD.ArgumentsKw|dict

   message elements, which it will return to the original _Caller_ in
   RESULT messages with

   *  RESULT.Arguments|list and RESULT.ArgumentsKw|dict

   In the error case, a _Callee_ MAY return an ERROR message with

   *  ERROR.Arguments|list and ERROR.ArgumentsKw|dict

   message elements, which again is returned to the original _Caller_.

   |  It is important to note that the above messages and message
   |  elements are the only ones free for use with application and user
   |  defined payloads.  In particular, even though the following WAMP
   |  messages and message element carry payloads defined by the
   |  specific WAMP authentication method used, they do _not_ carry
   |  arbitrary application payloads: HELLO.Details["authextra"]|dict,
   |  WELCOME.Details["authextra"]|dict, CHALLENGE.Extra|dict,
   |  AUTHENTICATE.Extra|dict.

   For example, the Session Meta API ({#session-metapi}) includes a
   procedure to kill all sessions by authid (#name-
   wampsessionkill_by_authid) with:

   *Positional arguments* (args|list)

   1.  authid|string - The authentication ID identifying sessions to
       close.

   *Keyword arguments* (kwargs|dict)

   1.  reason|uri - reason for closing sessions, sent to clients in
       GOODBYE.Reason
   2.  message|string - additional information sent to clients in
       GOODBYE.Details under the key "message".

   as arguments.  When successful, this procedure will return a call
   result with:

   *Positional results* (results|list)

   1.  sessions|list - The list of WAMP session IDs of session that were
       killed.

   *Keyword results* (kwresults|dict)

   1.  None

   To specify the call arguments in FlatBuffers IDL, we can define a
   FlatBuffers table for both args and kwargs:

   /// Call args/kwargs for "wamp.session.kill_by_authid"
   table SessionKillByAuthid
   {
       /// The WAMP authid of the sessions to kill.
       authid: string (wampuri);

       /// A reason URI provided to the killed session(s).
       reason: string (kwarg, wampuri);

       /// A message provided to the killed session(s).
       message: string (kwarg);
   }

   The table contains the list args as table elements (in order), unless
   the table element has an _Attribute_ kwarg, in which case the element
   one in kwarg.

   The attributes wampid and wampuri are special markers that denote
   values that follow the respective WAMP identifier rules for WAMP IDs
   and URIs.

   When successful, the procedure will return a list of WAMP session IDs
   of session that were killed.  Again, we can map this to FlatBuffers
   IDL:

   table WampIds
   {
       /// List of WAMP IDs.
       value: [uint64] (wampid);
   }

8.1.2.  WAMP IDL Attributes

   WAMP IDL uses _custom FlatBuffer attributes_ to

   *  mark kwarg fields which map to WAMP keyword argument vs arg
      (default)
   *  declare fields of a scalar base type to follow (stricter) WAMP
      rules (for IDs and URIs)
   *  specify the WAMP action type, that is _Procedure_ vs _Topic_, on
      service declarations

   |  "Attributes may be attached to a declaration, behind a field, or
   |  after the name of a table/struct/enum/union.  These may either
   |  have a value or not.  Some attributes like deprecated are
   |  understood by the compiler; user defined ones need to be declared
   |  with the attribute declaration (like priority in the example
   |  above), and are available to query if you parse the schema at
   |  runtime.  This is useful if you write your own code generators/
   |  editors etc., and you wish to add additional information specific
   |  to your tool (such as a help text)." (from source
   |  (https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/md__schemas.html)).

   The _Attributes_ used in WAMP IDL are defined in <WAMP API
   Catalog>/src/wamp.fbs, and are described in the following sections:

   *  arg, kwarg
   *  wampid
   *  wampname, wampname_s
   *  wampuri, wampuri_s, wampuri_p, wampuri_sp, wampuri_pp, wampuri_spp
   *  uuid
   *  ethadr
   *  type

   *  arg (default)
   *  kwarg

   One pair of args and kwarg types is declared by one FlatBuffer table
   with optional attributes on table fields, and the following rules
   apply or must be followed:

   1.  If neither arg nor kwarg attribute is provided, arg is assumed.
   2.  Only one of either arg or kwarg MUST be specified.
   3.  When a field has an attribute kwarg, all subsequent fields in the
       same table MUST also have attribute kwarg.

   *WAMP IDs and URIs*

   Integers which contain WAMP IDs use _Attribute_

   1.  wampid: WAMP ID, that is an integer [1, 2^53]

   Strings which contain WAMP names ("URI components"), for e.g. WAMP
   roles or authids use _Attributes_

   2.  wampname: WAMP URI component (aka "name"), loose rules (minimum
       required to combine to dotted URIs), must match regular
       expression ^[^\s\.#]+$.
   3.  wampname_s: WAMP URI component (aka "name"), strict rules (can be
       used as identifier in most languages), must match regular
       expression ^[\da-z_]+$.

   Strings which contain WAMP URIs or URI patterns use _Attribute_

   4.  wampuri: WAMP URI, loose rules, no empty URI components (aka
       "concrete or fully qualified URI"), must match regular expression
       ^([^\s\.#]+\.)*([^\s\.#]+)$.
   5.  wampuri_s: WAMP URI, strict rules, no empty URI components, must
       match regular expression ^([\da-z_]+\.)*([\da-z_]+)$.
   6.  wampuri_p: WAMP URI or URI (prefix or wildcard) pattern, loose
       rules (minimum required to combine to dotted URIs), must match
       regular expression ^(([^\s\.#]+\.)|\.)*([^\s\.#]+)?$.
   7.  wampuri_sp: WAMP URI or URI (prefix or wildcard) pattern, strict
       rules (can be used as identifier in most languages), must match
       regular expression ^(([\da-z_]+\.)|\.)*([\da-z_]+)?$.
   8.  wampuri_pp: WAMP URI or URI prefix pattern, loose rules (minimum
       required to combine to dotted URIs), must match regular
       expression ^([^\s\.#]+\.)*([^\s\.#]*)$.
   9.  wampuri_spp: WAMP URI or URI prefix pattern, strict rules (can be
       used as identifier in most languages), must match regular
       expression ^([\da-z_]+\.)*([\da-z_]*)$.

   *Type/Object UUIDs*

   Types and generally any objects can be globally identified using
   UUIDs [RFC4122].  UUIDs can be used in WAMP IDL using the uuid
   _Attribute_.

   /// UUID (canonical textual representation).
   my_field1: string (uuid);

   /// UUID (128 bit binary).
   my_field2: uint128_t (uuid);

   The uint128_t is a struct type defined as

   /// An unsigned integer with 128 bits.
   struct uint128_t {
       /// Least significand 32 bits.
       w0: uint32;

       /// 2nd significand 32 bits.
       w1: uint32;

       /// 3rd significand 32 bits.
       w2: uint32;

       /// Most significand 32 bits.
       w3: uint32;
   }

   *Ethereum Addresses*

   Ethereum addresses can be used to globally identify types or
   generally any object where the global ID also needs to be conflict
   free, consensually shared and owned by a respective Ethereum network
   user.  Ethereum addresses can be used in WAMP IDL using the ethadr
   _Attribute_:

   /// Ethereum address (checksummed HEX encoded address).
   my_field1: string (ethadr);

   /// Ethereum address (160 bit binary).
   my_field2: uint160_t (ethadr);

   The uint160_t is a struct type defined as

   *WAMP Actions or Service Elements*

   The type of WAMP service element *procedure*, *topic* or *interface*
   is designated using the _Attribute_

   1.  type: one of "procedure", "topic" or "interface"

   The type _Attribute_ can be used to denote WAMP service interfaces,
   e.g. continuing with above WAMP Meta API procedure example, the
   wamp.session.kill_by_authid procedure can be declared like this:

   rpc_service IWampMeta(type: "interface",
                         uuid: "88711231-3d95-44bc-9464-58d871dd7fd7",
                         wampuri: "wamp")
   {
       session_kill_by_authid (SessionKillByAuthid): WampIds (
           type: "procedure",
           wampuri: "wamp.session.kill_by_authid"
       );
   }

   The value of attribute type specifies a WAMP _Procedure_, and the
   call arguments and result types of the procedure are given by:

   *  SessionKillByAuthid: procedure call arguments args (positional
      argument) and kwargs (keyword arguments) call argument follow this
      type
   *  WampIds: procedure call results args (positional results) and
      kwargs (keyword results)

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-AP                  September 2025


   The procedure will be registered under the WAMP URI
   wamp.session.kill_by_authid on the respective realm.

8.1.3.  WAMP Service Declaration

   WAMP services include

   *  _Procedures_ registered by _Callees_, available for calling from
      _Callers_
   *  _Topics_ published to by _Publishers_, available for subscribing
      by _Subscribers_

   We map the two WAMP service types to FlatBuffers IDL using the
   _Attribute_ type == "procedure" | "topic" as in this example:

   rpc_service IWampMeta(type: "interface",
                         uuid: "88711231-3d95-44bc-9464-58d871dd7fd7",
                         wampuri: "wamp")
   {
       session_kill_by_authid (SessionKillByAuthid): WampIds (
           type: "procedure",
           wampuri: "wamp.session.kill_by_authid"
       );

       session_on_leave (SessionInfo): Void (
           type: "topic",
           wampuri: "wamp.session.on_leave"
       );
   }

   When the procedure wamp.session.kill_by_authid is called to kill all
   sessions with a given authid, the procedure will return a list of
   WAMP session IDs of the killed sessions via WampIds.  Independently,
   meta events on topic wamp.session.on_leave are published with
   detailed SessionInfo of the sessions left as event payload.  This
   follows a common "do-something-and-notify-observers" pattern for a
   pair of a procedure and topic working together.

   The _Interface_ then collects a number of _Procedures_ and _Topics_
   under one named unit of type == "interface" which includes a UUID in
   an uuid _Attribute_.

   *Declaring Services*

   Declaring services involves three element types:

   *  _Topics_
   *  _Procedures_

   *  _Interfaces_

   The general form for declaring _Topics_ is:

   <TOPIC-METHOD> (<TOPIC-PAYLOAD-TABLE>): Void (
       type: "topic",
       wampuri: <TOPIC-URI>
   );

   The application payload transmitted in EVENTs is typed via <TOPIC-
   PAYLOAD-TABLE>.  The return type MUST always be Void, which is a
   dummy marker type declared in wamp.fbs.

   |  Note: With _Acknowledge Event Delivery_ (future), when a
   |  _Subscriber_ receives an EVENT, the _Subscriber_ will return an
   |  _Event-Acknowledgement_ including args/ kwargs.  Once we do have
   |  this feature in WAMP PubSub, the type of the _Event-
   |  Acknowledgement_ can be specified using a non-Void return type.

   The general form for declaring _Procedures_ is:

   <PROCEDURE-METHOD> (<CALL-PAYLOAD-TABLE>): <CALLRESULT-PAYLOAD-TABLE> (
       type: "procedure",
       wampuri: <PROCEDURE-URI>
   );

   The application payload transmitted in CALLs is typed via <CALL-
   PAYLOAD-TABLE>.  The return type of the CALL is typed via
   <CALLRESULT-PAYLOAD-TABLE>.

   The general form for declaring _Interfaces_, which collect
   _Procedures_ and _Topics_ is:

   rpc_service <INTERFACE> (
       type: "interface",
       uuid: <INTERFACE-UUID>,
       wampuri: <INTERFACE-URI-PREFIX>
   ) {
       /// Method declarations of WAMP Procedures and Topics
   }

   |  Note: We are reusing FlatBuffers IDL here, specifically the
   |  rpc_service service definitions which were designed for gRPC
   |  (https://grpc.io/blog/grpc-flatbuffers/).  We reuse this element
   |  to declare both WAMP _Topics_ and _Procedures_ by using the type
   |  Attribute.  Do not get confused with "rpc" in rpc_service.

8.2.3.  Catalog Sharing and Publication

   *Archive File Preparation*

   The ZIP (https://linux.die.net/man/1/zip) archive format and tools,
   by default, include filesystem and other metadata from the host
   producing the archive.  That information usually changes, per-archive
   run, as e.g. the current datetime is included, which obviously
   progresses.

   When sharing and publishing a WAMP Interface Catalog, it is crucial
   that the archive only depends on the actual contents of the
   compressed files.

   Removing all unwanted ZIP archive metadata can be achieved using
   stripzip (https://github.com/KittyHawkCorp/stripzip):

   stripzip example.zip

   The user build scripts for compiling and bundling an Interface
   Catalog ZIP file MUST be repeatable, and only depend on the input
   source files.  A build process that fulfills this requirement is
   called Reproducible build (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
   Reproducible_builds).

   The easiest way to check if your build scripts producing example.zip
   is reproducible is repeat the build and check that the file
   fingerprint of the resulting archive stays the same:

   openssl sha256 example.zip

8.3.  Interface Reflection

   Feature status: *sketch*

   _Reflection_ denotes the ability of WAMP peers to examine the
   procedures, topics and errors provided or used by other peers.

   I.e. a WAMP _Caller_, _Callee_, _Subscriber_ or _Publisher_ may be
   interested in retrieving a machine readable list and description of
   WAMP procedures and topics it is authorized to access or provide in
   the context of a WAMP session with a _Dealer_ or _Broker_.

   Reflection may be useful in the following cases:

   *  documentation
   *  discoverability
   *  generating stubs and proxies

   WAMP predefines the following procedures for performing run-time
   reflection on WAMP peers which act as _Brokers_ and/or _Dealers_.

   Predefined WAMP reflection procedures to _list_ resources by type:

       wamp.reflection.topic.list
       wamp.reflection.procedure.list
       wamp.reflection.error.list

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-AP                  September 2025


   Predefined WAMP reflection procedures to _describe_ resources by
   type:

       wamp.reflection.topic.describe
       wamp.reflection.procedure.describe
       wamp.reflection.error.describe

   A peer that acts as a _Broker_ SHOULD announce support for the
   reflection API by sending

       HELLO.Details.roles.broker.reflection|bool := true

   A peer that acts as a _Dealer_ SHOULD announce support for the
   reflection API by sending

       HELLO.Details.roles.dealer.reflection|bool := true

   |  Since _Brokers_ might provide (broker) procedures and _Dealers_
   |  might provide (dealer) topics, both SHOULD implement the complete
   |  API above (even if the peer only implements one of _Broker_ or
   |  _Dealer_ roles).

   *Reflection Events and Procedures*

   A topic or procedure is defined for reflection:

       wamp.reflect.define

   A topic or procedure is asked to be described (reflected upon):

       wamp.reflect.describe

   A topic or procedure has been defined for reflection:

       wamp.reflect.on_define

   A topic or procedure has been undefined from reflection:

       wamp.reflect.on_undefine

       wamp.error.no_such_realm

   The _Client_ attempted to authenticate for a non-existing _Role_

       wamp.error.no_such_principal

   The authentication as presented by the _Client_ is denied (e.g.
   "wrong password").

       wamp.error.authentication_denied

   The _Client_ authentication was rejected due to a technical runtime
   failure ("fail secure" operation).

       wamp.error.authentication_failed

   The _Client_ did not provide the required, non-anonymous,
   authentication information.

       wamp.error.authentication_required

10.3.  Authorization

   The _Principal_ is not authorized to perform such _Action_.

       wamp.error.authorization_denied

   Authorization of the _Principal_ to perform the given _Action_ was
   rejected due to a technical runtime failure ("fail secure"
   operation).

       wamp.error.authorization_failed

   Authorization of the _Principal_ is required to perform the given
   _Action_. This can be used for capability-based access control.

       wamp.error.authorization_required

10.4.  Remote Procedure Calls

   A _Dealer_ or _Callee_ terminated a call that timed out

       wamp.error.timeout

   A _Peer_ requested an interaction with an option that was disallowed
   by the _Router_

       wamp.error.option_not_allowed

   A _Router_ rejected client request to disclose its identity

       wamp.error.option_disallowed.disclose_me

   A _Router_ encountered a network failure

       wamp.error.network_failure

   A _Callee_ is not able to handle an invocation for a _call_ and
   intends for the _Router_ to re-route the _call_ to another fitting
   _Callee_. For details, refer to RPC Call Rerouting
   (ap_rpc_call_rerouting.md)

       wamp.error.unavailable

   A _Dealer_ could not perform a call, since a procedure with the given
   URI is registered, but all available registrations have responded
   with wamp.error.unavailable

       wamp.error.no_available_callee

   A _Dealer_ received a CALL message with advanced features that cannot
   be processed by the _Callee_

       wamp.error.feature_not_supported

10.5.  Terminology

   This chapter contains a list of technical terms used in this
   specification, along with their respective meanings.

   Implementations SHOULD use terms as defined here in their public
   interfaces and documentation, and SHOULD NOT reinvent or reinterpret
   terms.  Users SHOULD be able to transfer their WAMP knowledge from
   one implementation to another.  This is to support the overarching
   goal of WAMP to free application developers from restrictions when
   building distributed applications, both at the network level, and
   when choosing (or switching) the WAMP implementations used.

   Our goal is to maximize *user choice and experience* when developing
   WAMP-based applications, both formally (open protocol and open
   source) as well as practically (switching costs).

11.  IANA Considerations

   WAMP uses the Subprotocol Identifier wamp registered with the
   WebSocket Subprotocol Name Registry
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/websocket/websocket.xhtml),
   operated by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).

12.  Conformance Requirements

   All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-
   normative, as are all sections explicitly marked non-normative.
   Everything else in this specification is normative.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as
   "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and abort these
   steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word
   ("MUST", "SHOULD", "MAY", etc.) used in introducing the algorithm.

   Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps MAY
   be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is
   equivalent.

12.1.  Terminology and Other Conventions

   Key terms such as named algorithms or definitions are indicated like
   _this_ when they first occur, and are capitalized throughout the
   text.
