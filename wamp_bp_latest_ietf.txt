1.  WAMP Basic Profile

   This document defines the Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP).
   WAMP is a routed protocol that provides two messaging patterns:
   Publish & Subscribe and routed Remote Procedure Calls.  It is
   intended to connect application components in distributed
   applications.  WAMP uses WebSocket as its default transport, but can
   be transmitted via any other protocol that allows for ordered,
   reliable, bi-directional, and message-oriented communications.

1.1.  Basic vs Advanced Profile

   This document first describes a Basic Profile for WAMP in its
   entirety, before describing an Advanced Profile which extends the
   basic functionality of WAMP.

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-BP                      March 2023


   The separation into Basic and Advanced Profiles is intended to extend
   the reach of the protocol.  It allows implementations to start out
   with a minimal, yet operable and useful set of features, and to
   expand that set from there.  It also allows implementations that are
   tailored for resource-constrained environments, where larger feature
   sets would not be possible.  Here implementers can weigh between
   resource constraints and functionality requirements, then implement
   an optimal feature set for the circumstances.

   Advanced Profile features are announced during session establishment,
   so that different implementations can adjust their interactions to
   fit the commonly supported feature set.

1.2.  Introduction

   _This section is non-normative._

   The WebSocket protocol brings bi-directional real-time connections to
   the browser.  It defines an API at the message level, requiring users
   who want to use WebSocket connections in their applications to define
   their own semantics on top of it.

   The Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP) is intended to provide
   application developers with the semantics they need to handle
   messaging between components in distributed applications.

   WAMP was initially defined as a WebSocket sub-protocol, which
   provided Publish & Subscribe (PubSub) functionality as well as Remote
   Procedure Calls (RPC) for procedures implemented in a WAMP router.
   Feedback from implementers and users of this was included in a second
   version of the protocol which this document defines.  Among the
   changes was that WAMP can now run over any transport which is
   message-oriented, ordered, reliable, and bi-directional.

   WAMP is a routed protocol, with all components connecting to a _WAMP
   Router_, where the WAMP Router performs message routing between the
   components.

   WAMP provides two messaging patterns: _Publish & Subscribe_ and
   _routed Remote Procedure Calls_.

   Publish & Subscribe (PubSub) is an established messaging pattern
   where a component, the _Subscriber_, informs the router that it wants
   to receive information on a topic (i.e., it subscribes to a topic).
   Another component, a _Publisher_, can then publish to this topic, and
   the router distributes events to all Subscribers.

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-BP                      March 2023


   Routed Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) rely on the same sort of
   decoupling that is used by the Publish & Subscribe pattern.  A
   component, the _Callee_, announces to the router that it provides a
   certain procedure, identified by a procedure name.  Other components,
   _Callers_, can then call the procedure, with the router invoking the
   procedure on the Callee, receiving the procedure's result, and then
   forwarding this result back to the Caller.  Routed RPCs differ from
   traditional client-server RPCs in that the router serves as an
   intermediary between the Caller and the Callee.

   The decoupling in routed RPCs arises from the fact that the Caller is
   no longer required to have knowledge of the Callee; it merely needs
   to know the identifier of the procedure it wants to call.  There is
   also no longer a need for a direct connection between the caller and
   the callee, since all traffic is routed.  This enables the calling of
   procedures in components which are not reachable externally (e.g. on
   a NATted connection) but which can establish an outgoing connection
   to the WAMP router.

   Combining these two patterns into a single protocol allows it to be
   used for the entire messaging requirements of an application, thus
   reducing technology stack complexity, as well as networking
   overheads.

1.3.  Protocol Overview

   _This section is non-normative._

1.3.1.  Realms, Sessions and Transports

   A Realm is a WAMP routing and administrative domain, optionally
   protected by authentication and authorization.  WAMP messages are
   only routed within a Realm.

   A Session is a transient conversation between two Peers attached to a
   Realm and running over a Transport.

   A Transport connects two WAMP Peers and provides a channel over which
   WAMP messages for a WAMP Session can flow in both directions.

   WAMP can run over any Transport which is message-based,
   bidirectional, reliable and ordered.

   The default transport for WAMP is WebSocket [RFC6455], where WAMP is
   an officially registered (http://www.iana.org/assignments/websocket/
   websocket.xml) subprotocol.

1.3.2.  Peers and Roles

   A WAMP Session connects two Peers, a Client and a Router.  Each WAMP
   Peer MUST implement one role, and MAY implement more roles.

   A Client MAY implement any combination of the Roles:

   *  Callee
   *  Caller
   *  Publisher
   *  Subscriber

   and a Router MAY implement either or both of the Roles:

   *  Dealer
   *  Broker

   |  This document describes WAMP as in client-to-router communication.
   |  Direct client-to-client communication is not supported by WAMP.
   |  Router-to-router communication MAY be defined by a specific router
   |  implementation.

   A _Router_ is a component which implements one or both of the Broker
   and Dealer roles.  A _Client_ is a component which implements any or
   all of the Subscriber, Publisher, Caller, or Callee roles.

   WAMP _Connections_ are established by Clients to a Router.
   Connections can use any _transport_ that is message-based, ordered,
   reliable and bi-directional, with WebSocket as the default transport.

   WAMP _Sessions_ are established over a WAMP Connection.  A WAMP
   Session is joined to a _Realm_ on a Router.  Routing occurs only
   between WAMP Sessions that have joined the same Realm.

   The _WAMP Basic Profile_ defines the parts of the protocol that are
   required to establish a WAMP connection, as well as for basic
   interactions between the four client and two router roles.  WAMP
   implementations are required to implement the Basic Profile, at
   minimum.

   The _WAMP Advanced Profile_ defines additions to the Basic Profile
   which greatly extend the utility of WAMP in real-world applications.
   WAMP implementations may support any subset of the Advanced Profile
   features.  They are required to announce those supported features
   during session establishment.

1.3.3.  Publish & Subscribe

   The Publish & Subscribe ("PubSub") messaging pattern involves peers
   of three different roles:

   *  Subscriber (Client)
   *  Publisher (Client)
   *  Broker (Router)

   A Publisher publishes events to topics by providing the topic URI and
   any payload for the event.  Subscribers of the topic will receive the
   event together with the event payload.

   Subscribers subscribe to topics they are interested in with Brokers.
   Publishers initiate publication first at Brokers.  Brokers route
   events incoming from Publishers to Subscribers that are subscribed to
   respective topics.

   The Publisher and Subscriber will usually run application code, while
   the Broker works as a generic router for events decoupling Publishers
   from Subscribers.

1.3.4.  Remote Procedure Calls

   The (routed) Remote Procedure Call ("RPC") messaging pattern involves
   peers of three different roles:

   *  Callee (Client)
   *  Caller (Client)
   *  Dealer (Router)

   A Caller issues calls to remote procedures by providing the procedure
   URI and any arguments for the call.  The Callee will execute the
   procedure using the supplied arguments to the call and return the
   result of the call to the Caller.

   Callees register procedures they provide with Dealers.  Callers
   initiate procedure calls first to Dealers.  Dealers route calls
   incoming from Callers to Callees implementing the procedure called,
   and route call results back from Callees to Callers.

   The Caller and Callee will usually run application code, while the
   Dealer works as a generic router for remote procedure calls
   decoupling Callers and Callees.

1.4.  Design Aspects

   _This section is non-normative._

   WAMP was designed to be performant, safe and easy to implement.  Its
   entire design was driven by a implement, get feedback, adjust cycle.

   An initial version of the protocol was publicly released in March
   2012.  The intent was to gain insight through implementation and use,
   and integrate these into a second version of the protocol, where
   there would be no regard for compatibility between the two versions.
   Several interoperable, independent implementations were released, and
   feedback from the implementers and users was collected.

   The second version of the protocol, which this RFC covers, integrates
   this feedback.  Routed Remote Procedure Calls are one outcome of
   this, where the initial version of the protocol only allowed the
   calling of procedures provided by the router.  Another, related
   outcome was the strict separation of routing and application logic.

   While WAMP was originally developed to use WebSocket as a transport,
   with JSON for serialization, experience in the field revealed that
   other transports and serialization formats were better suited to some
   use cases.  For instance, with the use of WAMP in the Internet of
   Things sphere, resource constraints play a much larger role than in
   the browser, so any reduction of resource usage in WAMP
   implementations counts.  This lead to the decoupling of WAMP from any
   particular transport or serialization, with the establishment of
   minimum requirements for both.

1.4.1.  Application Code

   WAMP is designed for application code to run within Clients, i.e.
   _Peers_ having the roles Callee, Caller, Publisher, and Subscriber.

   Routers, i.e. Peers of the roles Brokers and Dealers are responsible
   for *generic call and event routing* and do not run application code.

   This allows the transparent exchange of Broker and Dealer
   implementations without affecting the application and to distribute
   and deploy application components flexibly.

   |  Note that a *program* that implements, for instance, the Dealer
   |  role might at the same time implement, say, a built-in Callee.  It
   |  is the Dealer and Broker that are generic, not the program.

1.4.2.  Language Agnostic

   WAMP is language agnostic, i.e. can be implemented in any programming
   language.  At the level of arguments that may be part of a WAMP
   message, WAMP takes a 'superset of all' approach.  WAMP
   implementations may support features of the implementing language for
   use in arguments, e.g. keyword arguments.

1.4.3.  Symmetric Messaging

   It is important to note that though the establishment of a Transport
   might have a inherent asymmetry (like a TCP client establishing a
   WebSocket connection to a server), and Clients establish WAMP
   sessions by attaching to Realms on Routers, WAMP itself is designed
   to be fully symmetric for application components.

   After the transport and a session have been established, any
   application component may act as Caller, Callee, Publisher and
   Subscriber at the same time.  And Routers provide the fabric on top
   of which WAMP runs a symmetric application messaging service.

1.4.4.  Peers with multiple Roles

   Note that Peers might implement more than one role: e.g. a Peer might
   act as Caller, Publisher and Subscriber at the same time.  Another
   Peer might act as both a Broker and a Dealer.

1.4.5.  Relationship to WebSocket

   WAMP uses WebSocket as its default transport binding, and is a
   registered WebSocket subprotocol.

2.  Building Blocks

   WAMP is defined with respect to the following building blocks

   1.  Identifiers
   2.  Serializers
   3.  Transports

   For each building block, WAMP only assumes a defined set of
   requirements, which allows to run WAMP variants with different
   concrete bindings.

2.1.  Identifiers

2.1.1.  URIs

   WAMP needs to identify the following persistent resources:

   1.  Topics
   2.  Procedures
   3.  Errors

   These are identified in WAMP using Uniform Resource Identifiers
   (URIs) [RFC3986] that MUST be Unicode strings.

   When using JSON as WAMP serialization format, URIs (as other strings)
   are transmitted in UTF-8 [RFC3629] encoding.

   _Examples_

   *  com.myapp.mytopic1
   *  com.myapp.myprocedure1
   *  com.myapp.myerror1

   The URIs are understood to form a single, global, hierarchical
   namespace for WAMP.  The namespace is unified for topics, procedures
   and errors, that is these different resource types do NOT have
   separate namespaces.

   To avoid resource naming conflicts, the package naming convention
   from Java is used, where URIs SHOULD begin with (reversed) domain
   names owned by the organization defining the URI.

   *Relaxed/Loose URIs*

   URI components (the parts between two .s, the head part up to the
   first ., the tail part after the last .) MUST NOT contain a ., # or
   whitespace characters and MUST NOT be empty (zero-length strings).

   The restriction not to allow . in component strings is due to the
   fact that . is used to separate components, and WAMP associates
   semantics with resource hierarchies, such as in pattern-based
   subscriptions that are part of the Advanced Profile.  The restriction
   not to allow empty (zero-length) strings as components is due to the
   fact that this may be used to denote wildcard components with
   pattern-based subscriptions and registrations in the Advanced
   Profile.  The character # is not allowed since this is reserved for
   internal use by Dealers and Brokers.

   As an example, the following regular expression could be used in
   Python to check URIs according to the above rules, when *NO empty URI
   components are allowed*:

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-BP                      March 2023


   pattern = re.compile(r"^([^\s\.#]+\.)*([^\s\.#]+)$")

   When *empty URI components are allowed* (which is the case for
   specific messages that are part of the Advanced Profile), this
   following regular expression can be used (shown used in Python):

   pattern = re.compile(r"^(([^\s\.#]+\.)|\.)*([^\s\.#]+)?$")

   *Strict URIs*

   While the above rules MUST be followed, following a stricter URI rule
   is recommended: URI components SHOULD only contain lower-case
   letters, digits and _.

   As an example, the following regular expression could be used in
   Python to check URIs according to the above rules, when *NO empty URI
   components are allowed*:

   pattern = re.compile(r"^([0-9a-z_]+\.)*([0-9a-z_]+)$")

   When *empty URI components are allowed*, which is the case for
   specific messages that are part of the Advanced Profile, the
   following regular expression can be used (shown in Python):

   pattern = re.compile(r"^(([0-9a-z_]+\.)|\.)*([0-9a-z_]+)?$")

   Following the suggested regular expression for *strict URIs* will
   make URI components valid identifiers in most languages (modulo URIs
   starting with a digit and language keywords) and the use of lower-
   case only will make those identifiers unique in languages that have
   case-insensitive identifiers.  Following this suggestion can allow
   implementations to map topics, procedures and errors to the language
   environment in a completely transparent way.

   *Reserved URIs*

   Further, application URIs MUST NOT use wamp as a first URI component,
   since this is reserved for URIs predefined with the WAMP protocol
   itself.

   _Examples_

   *  wamp.error.not_authorized
   *  wamp.error.procedure_already_exists

2.1.2.  IDs

   WAMP needs to identify the following ephemeral entities each in the
   scope noted:

   1.  Sessions (_global scope_)
   2.  Publications (_global scope_)
   3.  Subscriptions (_router scope_)
   4.  Registrations (_router scope_)
   5.  Requests (_session scope_)

   These are identified in WAMP using IDs that are integers between
   (inclusive) *1* and *2^53* (9007199254740992):

   *  IDs in the _global scope_ MUST be drawn _randomly_ from a _uniform
      distribution_ over the complete range [1, 2^53]
   *  IDs in the _router scope_ CAN be chosen freely by the specific
      router implementation
   *  IDs in the _session scope_ MUST be incremented by 1 beginning with
      1 (for each direction - _Client-to-Router_ and _Router-to-Client_)
      {#session_scope_id}

   |  The reason to choose the specific lower bound as 1 rather than 0
   |  is that 0 is the null-like (falsy) value for many programming
   |  languages.  The reason to choose the specific upper bound is that
   |  2^53 is the largest integer such that this integer and _all_
   |  (positive) smaller integers can be represented exactly in IEEE-754
   |  doubles.  Some languages (e.g.  JavaScript) use doubles as their
   |  sole number type.  Most languages do have signed and unsigned
   |  64-bit integer types that both can hold any value from the
   |  specified range.

   The following is a complete list of usage of IDs in the three
   categories for all WAMP messages.  For a full definition of these see
   messages section (#messages).

   *Global Scope IDs*

   *  WELCOME.Session
   *  PUBLISHED.Publication
   *  EVENT.Publication

   *Router Scope IDs*

   *  SUBSCRIBED.Subscription

   *  INVOCATION.Request
   *  YIELD.Request (mirrored INVOCATION.Request)
   *  INTERRUPT.Request (mirrored INVOCATION.Request)
   *  ERROR.Request (mirrored original request ID)

2.2.  Serializers

   WAMP is a message based protocol that requires serialization of
   messages to octet sequences to be sent out on the wire.

   A message serialization format is assumed that (at least) provides
   the following types:

   *  integer (non-negative)
   *  string (UTF-8 encoded Unicode)
   *  bool
   *  list
   *  dict (with string keys)

   |  WAMP _itself_ only uses the above types, e.g. it does not use the
   |  JSON data types number (non-integer) and null.  The _application
   |  payloads_ transmitted by WAMP (e.g. in call arguments or event
   |  payloads) may use other types a concrete serialization format
   |  supports.

   There is no required serialization or set of serializations for WAMP
   implementations (but each implementation MUST, of course, implement
   at least one serialization format).  Routers SHOULD implement more
   than one serialization format, enabling components using different
   kinds of serializations to connect to each other.

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-BP                      March 2023


   The WAMP Basic Profile defines the following bindings for message
   serialization:

   1.  JSON
   2.  MessagePack
   3.  CBOR

   Other bindings for serialization may be defined in the WAMP Advanced
   Profile.

   With JSON serialization, each WAMP message is serialized according to
   the JSON specification as described in [RFC7159].

   Further, binary data follows a convention for conversion to JSON
   strings.  For details see the Appendix.

   With MessagePack (https://msgpack.org/) serialization, each WAMP
   message is serialized according to the MessagePack specification
   (https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md).

   Version 5 or later of MessagePack MUST BE used, since this version is
   able to differentiate between strings and binary values.

   With CBOR serialization, each WAMP message is serialized according to
   the CBOR specification as described in [RFC8949].

2.3.  Transports

   WAMP assumes a transport with the following characteristics:

   1.  message-based
   2.  reliable
   3.  ordered
   4.  bidirectional (full-duplex)

   There is no required transport or set of transports for WAMP
   implementations (but each implementation MUST, of course, implement
   at least one transport).  Routers SHOULD implement more than one
   transport, enabling components using different kinds of transports to
   connect in an application.

2.3.1.  WebSocket Transport

   The default transport binding for WAMP is WebSocket ([RFC6455]).







Oberstein               Expires 7 September 2023               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-BP                      March 2023


   In the Basic Profile, WAMP messages are transmitted as WebSocket
   messages: each WAMP message is transmitted as a separate WebSocket
   message (not WebSocket frame).  The Advanced Profile may define other
   modes, e.g. a *batched mode* where multiple WAMP messages are
   transmitted via single WebSocket message.

   The WAMP protocol MUST BE negotiated during the WebSocket opening
   handshake between Peers using the WebSocket subprotocol negotiation
   mechanism ([RFC6455] section 4).

   WAMP uses the following WebSocket subprotocol identifiers (for
   unbatched modes):

   *  wamp.2.json
   *  wamp.2.msgpack
   *  wamp.2.cbor

   With wamp.2.json, _all_ WebSocket messages MUST BE of type *text*
   (UTF8 encoded payload) and use the JSON message serialization.

   With wamp.2.msgpack, _all_ WebSocket messages MUST BE of type
   *binary* and use the MessagePack message serialization.

   With wamp.2.cbor, _all_ WebSocket messages MUST BE of type *binary*
   and use the CBOR message serialization.

   |  To avoid incompatibilities merely due to naming conflicts with
   |  WebSocket subprotocol identifiers, implementers SHOULD register
   |  identifiers for additional serialization formats with the official
   |  WebSocket subprotocol registry.

2.3.2.  Transport and Session Lifetime

   WAMP implementations MAY choose to tie the lifetime of the underlying
   transport connection for a WAMP connection to that of a WAMP session,
   i.e. establish a new transport-layer connection as part of each new
   session establishment.  They MAY equally choose to allow re-use of a
   transport connection, allowing subsequent WAMP sessions to be
   established using the same transport connection.

   The diagram below illustrates the full transport connection and
   session lifecycle for an implementation which uses WebSocket over TCP
   as the transport and allows the re-use of a transport connection.

2.3.3.  Protocol errors

   WAMP implementations MUST abort sessions (disposing all of their
   resources such as subscriptions and registrations) on protocol errors
   caused by offending peers.

   Following scenarios have to be considered protocol errors:

   *  Receiving WELCOME message, after session was established.
   *  Receiving HELLO message, after session was established.

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-BP                      March 2023


   *  Receiving CHALLENGE message, after session was established.
   *  Receiving GOODBYE message, before session was established.
   *  Receiving ERROR message, before session was established.
   *  Receiving ERROR message with invalid REQUEST.Type.
   *  Receiving SUBSCRIBED message, before session was established.
   *  Receiving UNSUBSCRIBED message, before session was established.
   *  Receiving PUBLISHED message, before session was established.
   *  Receiving RESULT message, before session was established.
   *  Receiving REGISTERED message, before session was established.
   *  Receiving UNREGISTERED message, before session was established.
   *  Receiving INVOCATION message, before session was established.
   *  Receiving message with non-sequential (#session_scope_id) session
      scope (#session_scope_ids) request ID, such as SUBSCRIBE,
      UNSUBSCRIBE, PUBLISH, REGISTER, UNREGISTER, CALL and YIELD.
   *  Receiving protocol incompatible message, such as empty array,
      invalid WAMP message type id, etc.
   *  Catching error during message encoding/decoding.
   *  Any other exceptional scenario explicitly defined in any relevant
      section of this specification below (such as receiving a second
      HELLO within the lifetime of a session).

   In all such cases WAMP implementations:

   1.  MUST send an ABORT message to the offending peer, having reason
       wamp.error.protocol_violation and optional attributes in
       ABORT.Details such as a human readable error message.
   2.  MUST abort the WAMP session by disposing any allocated
       subscriptions/registrations for that particular client and
       without waiting for or processing any messages subsequently
       received from the peer,
   3.  SHOULD also drop the WAMP connection at transport level
       (recommended to prevent denial of service attacks)

3.  Messages

   All WAMP messages are a list with a first element MessageType
   followed by one or more message type specific elements:

       [MessageType|integer, ... one or more message type specific
           elements ...]

   The notation Element|type denotes a message element named Element of
   type type, where type is one of

   *  uri: a string URI as defined in URIs (#uris)
   *  id: an integer ID as defined in IDs (#ids)
   *  integer: a non-negative integer
   *  string: a Unicode string, including the empty string

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-BP                      March 2023


   *  bool: a boolean value (true or false) - integers MUST NOT be used
      instead of boolean value
   *  dict: a dictionary (map) where keys MUST be strings, keys MUST be
      unique and serialization order is undefined (left to the
      serializer being used)
   *  list: a list (array) where items can be again any of this
      enumeration

   _Example_

   A SUBSCRIBE message has the following format

       [SUBSCRIBE, Request|id, Options|dict, Topic|uri]

   Here is an example message conforming to the above format

       [32, 713845233, {}, "com.myapp.mytopic1"]

3.1.  Extensibility

   Some WAMP messages contain Options|dict or Details|dict elements.
   This allows for future extensibility and implementations that only
   provide subsets of functionality by ignoring unimplemented
   attributes.  Keys in Options and Details MUST be of type string and
   MUST match the regular expression [a-z][a-z0-9_]{2,} for WAMP
   predefined keys.  Implementations MAY use implementation-specific
   keys that MUST match the regular expression _[a-z0-9_]{3,}.
   Attributes unknown to an implementation MUST be ignored.

3.2.  No Polymorphism

   For a given MessageType and number of message elements the expected
   types are uniquely defined.  Hence there are no polymorphic messages
   in WAMP.  This leads to a message parsing and validation control flow
   that is efficient, simple to implement and simple to code for
   rigorous message format checking.

3.3.  Structure

   The application payload (that is call arguments, call results, event
   payload etc) is always at the end of the message element list.  The
   rationale is: Brokers and Dealers have no need to inspect (parse) the
   application payload.  Their business is call/event routing.  Having
   the application payload at the end of the list allows Brokers and
   Dealers to skip parsing it altogether.  This can improve efficiency
   and performance.

3.4.  Message Definitions

   WAMP defines the following messages that are explained in detail in
   the following sections.

   The messages concerning the WAMP session itself are mandatory for all
   Peers, i.e. a Client MUST implement HELLO, ABORT and GOODBYE, while a
   Router MUST implement WELCOME, ABORT and GOODBYE.

   All other messages are mandatory per role, i.e. in an implementation
   that only provides a Client with the role of Publisher MUST
   additionally implement sending PUBLISH and receiving PUBLISHED and
   ERROR messages.

3.4.1.  Session Lifecycle

3.4.1.1.  HELLO

   Sent by a Client to initiate opening of a WAMP session to a Router
   attaching to a Realm.

       [HELLO, Realm|uri, Details|dict]

3.4.1.2.  WELCOME

   Sent by a Router to accept a Client.  The WAMP session is now open.

       [WELCOME, Session|id, Details|dict]

3.4.1.3.  ABORT

   Sent by a Peer*to abort the opening of a WAMP session.  No response
   is expected.

       [ABORT, Details|dict, Reason|uri]

3.4.1.4.  GOODBYE

   Sent by a Peer to close a previously opened WAMP session.  Must be
   echo'ed by the receiving Peer.

       [GOODBYE, Details|dict, Reason|uri]

3.4.1.5.  ERROR

   Error reply sent by a Peer as an error response to different kinds of
   requests.

3.5.  Message Codes and Direction

   The following table lists the message type code for all messages
   defined in the WAMP basic profile and their direction between peer
   roles.

   Reserved codes may be used to identify additional message types in
   future standards documents.

   "Tx" indicates the message is sent by the respective role, and "Rx"
   indicates the message is received by the respective role.

3.6.  Extension Messages

   WAMP uses type codes from the core range [0, 255].  Implementations
   MAY define and use implementation specific messages with message type
   codes from the extension message range [256, 1023].  For example, a
   router MAY implement router-to-router communication by using
   extension messages.

3.7.  Empty Arguments and Keyword Arguments

   Implementations SHOULD avoid sending empty Arguments lists.

   E.g. a CALL message

       [CALL, Request|id, Options|dict, Procedure|uri, Arguments|list]

   where Arguments == [] SHOULD be avoided, and instead

       [CALL, Request|id, Options|dict, Procedure|uri]

   SHOULD be sent.

   Implementations SHOULD avoid sending empty ArgumentsKw dictionaries.

   E.g. a CALL message

    [CALL, Request|id, Options|dict, Procedure|uri, Arguments|list, ArgumentsKw|dict]

   where ArgumentsKw == {} SHOULD be avoided, and instead

       [CALL, Request|id, Options|dict, Procedure|uri, Arguments|list]

   SHOULD be sent when Arguments is non-empty.

4.  Sessions

   The message flow between Clients and Routers for opening and closing
   WAMP sessions involves the following messages:

   1.  HELLO
   2.  WELCOME
   3.  ABORT
   4.  GOODBYE

   The following state chart gives the states that a WAMP peer can be in
   during the session lifetime cycle.

4.1.  Session Establishment

4.1.1.  HELLO

   After the underlying transport has been established, the opening of a
   WAMP session is initiated by the Client sending a HELLO message to
   the Router

       [HELLO, Realm|uri, Details|dict]

   where



Oberstein               Expires 7 September 2023               [Page 27]

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-BP                      March 2023


   *  Realm is a string identifying the realm this session should attach
      to
   *  Details is a dictionary that allows to provide additional opening
      information (see below).

   The HELLO message MUST be the very first message sent by the Client
   after the transport has been established.

   In the WAMP Basic Profile without session authentication the Router
   will reply with a WELCOME or ABORT message.

       ,------.          ,------.
       |Client|          |Router|
       `--+---'          `--+---'
          |      HELLO      |
          | ---------------->
          |                 |
          |     WELCOME     |
          | <----------------
       ,--+---.          ,--+---.
       |Client|          |Router|
       `------'          `------'

   A WAMP session starts its lifetime when the Router has sent a WELCOME
   message to the Client, and ends when the underlying transport closes
   or when the session is closed explicitly by either peer sending the
   GOODBYE message (see below).

   It is a protocol error (#protocol_errors) to receive a second HELLO
   message during the lifetime of the session and the Peer MUST close
   the session if that happens.

   *Client: Role and Feature Announcement*

   WAMP uses _Role & Feature announcement_ instead of _protocol
   versioning_ to allow

   *  implementations only supporting subsets of functionality
   *  future extensibility

   A Client must announce the roles it supports via
   Hello.Details.roles|dict, with a key mapping to a
   Hello.Details.roles.<role>|dict where <role> can be:

   *  publisher
   *  subscriber
   *  caller
   *  callee

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-BP                      March 2023


   A Client can support any combination of the above roles but must
   support at least one role.

   The <role>|dict is a dictionary describing features supported by the
   peer for that role.

   This MUST be empty for WAMP Basic Profile implementations, and MUST
   be used by implementations implementing parts of the Advanced Profile
   to list the specific set of features they support.

   _Example: A Client that implements the Publisher and Subscriber roles
   of the WAMP Basic Profile._

       [1, "somerealm", {
         "roles": {
             "publisher": {},
             "subscriber": {}
         }
       }]

   *Client: Agent Identification*

   When a software agent operates in a network protocol, it often
   identifies itself, its application type, operating system, software
   vendor, or software revision, by submitting a characteristic
   identification string to its operating peer.

   Similar to what browsers do with the User-Agent HTTP header, both the
   HELLO and the WELCOME message MAY disclose the WAMP implementation in
   use to its peer:

       HELLO.Details.agent|string

   and

       WELCOME.Details.agent|string

   _Example: A Client "HELLO" message._

       [1, "somerealm", {
            "agent": "AutobahnJS-0.9.14",
            "roles": {
               "subscriber": {},
               "publisher": {}
            }
       }]

   _Example: A Router "WELCOME" message._

           "roles": {
             "broker": {}
           }
       }]

4.1.2.  WELCOME

   A Router completes the opening of a WAMP session by sending a WELCOME
   reply message to the Client.

       [WELCOME, Session|id, Details|dict]

   where

   *  Session MUST be a randomly generated ID specific to the WAMP
      session.  This applies for the lifetime of the session.
   *  Details is a dictionary that allows to provide additional
      information regarding the open session (see below).

   In the WAMP Basic Profile without session authentication, a WELCOME
   message MUST be the first message sent by the Router, directly in
   response to a HELLO message received from the Client.  Extensions in
   the Advanced Profile MAY include intermediate steps and messages for
   authentication.

   |  Note.  The behavior if a requested Realm does not presently exist
   |  is router-specific.  A router may e.g. automatically create the
   |  realm, or deny the establishment of the session with a ABORT reply
   |  message.

   *Router: Role and Feature Announcement*

   Similar to a Client announcing Roles and Features supported in the
   `HELLO message, a Router announces its supported Roles and Features
   in the WELCOME message.

   A Router MUST announce the roles it supports via
   Welcome.Details.roles|dict, with a key mapping to a
   Welcome.Details.roles.<role>|dict where <role> can be:

   *  broker
   *  dealer

   A Router must support at least one role, and MAY support both roles.

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-BP                      March 2023


   The <role>|dict is a dictionary describing features supported by the
   peer for that role.  With WAMP Basic Profile implementations, this
   MUST be empty, but MUST be used by implementations implementing parts
   of the Advanced Profile to list the specific set of features they
   support

   _Example: A Router implementing the Broker role of the WAMP Basic
   Profile._

       [2, 9129137332, {
          "roles": {
             "broker": {}
          }
       }]

4.1.3.  ABORT

   Both the Router and the Client may abort a WAMP session by sending an
   ABORT message.

       [ABORT, Details|dict, Reason|uri]

   where

   *  Reason MUST be a URI.
   *  Details MUST be a dictionary that allows to provide additional,
      optional closing information (see below).

   No response to an ABORT message is expected.

   There are few scenarios, when  (U+00A0)ABORT is used:

   *  During session opening, if peer decided to abort connect.

       ,------.          ,------.
       |Client|          |Router|
       `--+---'          `--+---'
          |      HELLO      |
          | ---------------->
          |                 |
          |      ABORT      |
          | <----------------
       ,--+---.          ,--+---.

       [3, {"message": "The realm does not exist."},
           "wamp.error.no_such_realm"]

   *  After session is opened, when  (U+00A0)protocol violation happens
      (see "Protocol errors" section).

   _Examples_

   *  Router received second HELLO message.

       [3, {"message":
               "Received HELLO message after session was established."},
           "wamp.error.protocol_violation"]

   *  Client peer received second WELCOME message

     [3, {"message":
             "Received WELCOME message after session was established."},
         "wamp.error.protocol_violation"]

4.2.  Session Closing

4.2.1.  GOODBYE

   A WAMP session starts its lifetime with the Router sending a WELCOME
   message to the Client and ends when the underlying transport
   disappears or when the WAMP session is closed explicitly by a GOODBYE
   message sent by one Peer and a GOODBYE message sent from the other
   Peer in response.

       [GOODBYE, Details|dict, Reason|uri]

   where

   *  Reason MUST be a URI.
   *  Details MUST be a dictionary that allows to provide additional,
      optional closing information (see below).

   _Example_. One Peer initiates closing

       [6, {"message": "The host is shutting down now."},
           "wamp.close.system_shutdown"]

   and the other peer replies

       [6, {}, "wamp.close.goodbye_and_out"]

   _Example_. One Peer initiates closing

       [6, {}, "wamp.close.close_realm"]

   and the other peer replies

       [6, {}, "wamp.close.goodbye_and_out"]

   *Difference between ABORT and GOODBYE*

   The differences between ABORT and GOODBYE messages is that 
   (U+00A0)ABORT is never replied to by a Peer, whereas GOODBYE must be
   replied to by the receiving Peer.

   |  Though ABORT and GOODBYE are structurally identical, using
   |  different message types serves to reduce overloaded meaning of
   |  messages and simplify message handling code.

5.  Publish and Subscribe

   All of the following features for Publish & Subscribe are mandatory
   for WAMP Basic Profile implementations supporting the respective
   roles, i.e. _Publisher_, _Subscriber_ and _Broker_.

5.1.  Subscribing and Unsubscribing

   The message flow between Clients implementing the role of Subscriber
   and Routers implementing the role of Broker for subscribing and
   unsubscribing involves the following messages:

   1.  SUBSCRIBE
   2.  SUBSCRIBED
   3.  UNSUBSCRIBE
   4.  UNSUBSCRIBED
   5.  ERROR

       ,---------.          ,------.             ,----------.

       `---------'          `------'             `----------'

   A Subscriber may subscribe to zero, one or more topics, and a
   Publisher publishes to topics without knowledge of subscribers.

   Upon subscribing to a topic via the SUBSCRIBE message, a Subscriber
   will receive any future events published to the respective topic by
   Publishers, and will receive those events asynchronously.

   A subscription lasts for the duration of a session, unless a
   Subscriber opts out from a previously established subscription via
   the UNSUBSCRIBE message.

   |  A Subscriber may have more than one event handler attached to the
   |  same subscription.  This can be implemented in different ways: a)
   |  a Subscriber can recognize itself that it is already subscribed
   |  and just attach another handler to the subscription for incoming
   |  events, b) or it can send a new SUBSCRIBE message to broker (as it
   |  would be first) and upon receiving a SUBSCRIBED.Subscription|id it
   |  already knows about, attach the handler to the existing
   |  subscription

5.1.1.  SUBSCRIBE

   A Subscriber communicates its interest in a topic to a Broker by
   sending a SUBSCRIBE message:

       [SUBSCRIBE, Request|id, Options|dict, Topic|uri]

   where

   *  Request is a sequential ID in the _session scope_, incremented by
      the Subscriber and used to correlate the Broker's response with
      the request.
   *  Options is a dictionary that allows to provide additional
      subscription request details in a extensible way.  This is
      described further below.
   *  Topic is the topic the Subscriber wants to subscribe to and is a
      URI.

   _Example_

       [32, 713845233, {}, "com.myapp.mytopic1"]

   A Broker, receiving a SUBSCRIBE message, can fullfill or reject the
   subscription, so it answers with SUBSCRIBED or ERROR messages.

5.1.2.  SUBSCRIBED

   If the Broker is able to fulfill and allow the subscription, it
   answers by sending a SUBSCRIBED message to the Subscriber

       [SUBSCRIBED, SUBSCRIBE.Request|id, Subscription|id]

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-BP                      March 2023


   where

   *  SUBSCRIBE.Request is the ID from the original subscription
      request.
   *  Subscription is an ID chosen by the Broker for the subscription.

   _Example_

       [33, 713845233, 5512315355]

   |  Note.  The Subscription ID chosen by the broker need not be unique
   |  to the subscription of a single Subscriber, but may be assigned to
   |  the Topic, or the combination of the Topic and some or all
   |  Options, such as the topic pattern matching method to be used.
   |  Then this ID may be sent to all Subscribers for the Topic or Topic
   |  / Options combination.  This allows the Broker to serialize an
   |  event to be delivered only once for all actual receivers of the
   |  event.
   |  
   |  In case of receiving a SUBSCRIBE message from the same Subscriber
   |  and to already subscribed topic, Broker should answer with
   |  SUBSCRIBED message, containing the existing Subscription|id.

5.1.3.  Subscribe ERROR

   When the request for subscription cannot be fulfilled by the Broker,
   the Broker sends back an ERROR message to the Subscriber

       [ERROR, SUBSCRIBE, SUBSCRIBE.Request|id, Details|dict, Error|uri]

   where

   *  SUBSCRIBE.Request is the ID from the original request.
   *  Error is a URI that gives the error of why the request could not
      be fulfilled.

   _Example_

       [8, 32, 713845233, {}, "wamp.error.not_authorized"]

5.1.4.  UNSUBSCRIBE

   When a Subscriber is no longer interested in receiving events for a
   subscription it sends an UNSUBSCRIBE message

       [UNSUBSCRIBE, Request|id, SUBSCRIBED.Subscription|id]

   where

   *  Request is a sequential ID in the _session scope_, incremented by
      the Subscriber and used to correlate the Broker's response with
      the request.
   *  SUBSCRIBED.Subscription is the ID for the subscription to
      unsubscribe from, originally handed out by the Broker to the
      Subscriber.

   _Example_

       [34, 85346237, 5512315355]

5.1.5.  UNSUBSCRIBED

   Upon successful unsubscription, the Broker sends an UNSUBSCRIBED
   message to the Subscriber

       [UNSUBSCRIBED, UNSUBSCRIBE.Request|id]

   where

   *  UNSUBSCRIBE.Request is the ID from the original request.

   _Example_

       [35, 85346237]

5.1.6.  Unsubscribe ERROR

   When the request fails, the Broker sends an ERROR

    [ERROR, UNSUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE.Request|id, Details|dict, Error|uri]

   where

   *  UNSUBSCRIBE.Request is the ID from the original request.
   *  Error is a URI that gives the error of why the request could not
      be fulfilled.

   _Example_

       [8, 34, 85346237, {}, "wamp.error.no_such_subscription"]

5.2.  Publishing and Events

   The message flow between Publishers, a Broker and Subscribers for
   publishing to topics and dispatching events involves the following
   messages:

5.2.1.  PUBLISH

   When a Publisher requests to publish an event to some topic, it sends
   a PUBLISH message to a Broker:

       [PUBLISH, Request|id, Options|dict, Topic|uri]

   or

       [PUBLISH, Request|id, Options|dict, Topic|uri, Arguments|list]

   or

       [PUBLISH, Request|id, Options|dict, Topic|uri, Arguments|list,
           ArgumentsKw|dict]

   where

   *  Request is a sequential ID in the _session scope_, incremented by
      the Publisher and used to correlate the Broker's response with the
      request.
   *  Options is a dictionary that allows to provide additional
      publication request details in an extensible way.  This is
      described further below.
   *  Topic is the topic published to.
   *  Arguments is a list of application-level event payload elements.
      The list may be of zero length.

Internet-Draft                   WAMP-BP                      March 2023


   *  ArgumentsKw is an optional dictionary containing application-level
      event payload, provided as keyword arguments.  The dictionary may
      be empty.

   If the Broker allows and is able to fulfill the publication, the
   Broker will send the event to all current Subscribers of the topic of
   the published event.

   By default, publications are unacknowledged, and the Broker will not
   respond, whether the publication was successful indeed or not.  This
   behavior can be changed with the option
   PUBLISH.Options.acknowledge|bool (see below).

   _Example_

       [16, 239714735, {}, "com.myapp.mytopic1"]

   _Example_

       [16, 239714735, {}, "com.myapp.mytopic1", ["Hello, world!"]]

   _Example_

       [16, 239714735, {}, "com.myapp.mytopic1", [], {"color": "orange",
           "sizes": [23, 42, 7]}]

5.2.2.  PUBLISHED

   If the Broker is able to fulfill and allowing the publication, and
   PUBLISH.Options.acknowledge == true, the Broker replies by sending a
   PUBLISHED message to the Publisher:

       [PUBLISHED, PUBLISH.Request|id, Publication|id]

   where

   *  PUBLISH.Request is the ID from the original publication request.
   *  Publication is an ID chosen by the Broker for the publication.

   _Example_

       [17, 239714735, 4429313566]

5.2.3.  Publish ERROR

   When the request for publication cannot be fulfilled by the Broker,
   and PUBLISH.Options.acknowledge == true, the Broker sends back an
   ERROR message to the Publisher

   where

   *  PUBLISH.Request is the ID from the original publication request.

      be fulfilled.

   _Example_

       [8, 16, 239714735, {}, "wamp.error.not_authorized"]

5.2.4.  EVENT

   When a publication is successful and a Broker dispatches the event,
   it determines a list of receivers for the event based on Subscribers
   for the topic published to and, possibly, other information in the
   event.

   Note that the Publisher of an event will never receive the published
   event even if the Publisher is also a Subscriber of the topic
   published to.

   |  The Advanced Profile provides options for more detailed control
   |  over publication.

   When a Subscriber is deemed to be a receiver, the Broker sends the
   Subscriber an EVENT message:

    [EVENT, SUBSCRIBED.Subscription|id, PUBLISHED.Publication|id, Details|dict]

   or

    [EVENT, SUBSCRIBED.Subscription|id, PUBLISHED.Publication|id, Details|dict,
        PUBLISH.Arguments|list]

   or

    [EVENT, SUBSCRIBED.Subscription|id, PUBLISHED.Publication|id, Details|dict,
        PUBLISH.Arguments|list, PUBLISH.ArgumentsKw|dict]

   where

   *  SUBSCRIBED.Subscription is the ID for the subscription under which
      the Subscriber receives the event - the ID for the subscription
      originally handed out by the Broker to the Subscribe*.
   *  PUBLISHED.Publication is the ID of the publication of the
      published event.

   *  Details is a dictionary that allows the Broker to provide
      additional event details in a extensible way.  This is described
      further below.
   *  PUBLISH.Arguments is the application-level event payload that was

6.  Remote Procedure Calls

   All of the following features for Remote Procedure Calls are
   mandatory for WAMP Basic Profile implementations supporting the
   respective roles.

6.1.  Registering and Unregistering

   The message flow between Callees and a Dealer for registering and
   unregistering endpoints to be called over RPC involves the following
   messages:

   1.  REGISTER
   2.  REGISTERED
   3.  UNREGISTER
   4.  UNREGISTERED
   5.  ERROR

6.1.1.  REGISTER

   A Callee announces the availability of an endpoint implementing a
   procedure with a Dealer by sending a REGISTER message:

       [REGISTER, Request|id, Options|dict, Procedure|uri]

   where

   *  Request is a sequential ID in the _session scope_, incremented by
      the Callee and used to correlate the Dealer's response with the
      request.
   *  Options is a dictionary that allows to provide additional
      registration request details in a extensible way.  This is
      described further below.
   *  Procedureis the procedure the Callee wants to register

   _Example_

       [64, 25349185, {}, "com.myapp.myprocedure1"]

6.1.2.  REGISTERED

   If the Dealer is able to fulfill and allowing the registration, it
   answers by sending a REGISTERED message to the Callee:

       [REGISTERED, REGISTER.Request|id, Registration|id]

   where

   *  REGISTER.Request is the ID from the original request.
   *  Registration is an ID chosen by the Dealer for the registration.

   _Example_

       [65, 25349185, 2103333224]

6.1.3.  Register ERROR

   When the request for registration cannot be fulfilled by the Dealer,
   the Dealer sends back an ERROR message to the Callee:

       [ERROR, REGISTER, REGISTER.Request|id, Details|dict, Error|uri]

   where

   *  REGISTER.Request is the ID from the original request.
   *  Error is a URI that gives the error of why the request could not
      be fulfilled.

   _Example_

       [8, 64, 25349185, {}, "wamp.error.procedure_already_exists"]

6.1.4.  UNREGISTER

   When a Callee is no longer willing to provide an implementation of
   the registered procedure, it sends an UNREGISTER message to the
   Dealer:

       [UNREGISTER, Request|id, REGISTERED.Registration|id]

   where

   *  Request is a sequential ID in the _session scope_, incremented by
      the Callee and used to correlate the Dealer's response with the
      request.
   *  REGISTERED.Registration is the ID for the registration to revoke,
      originally handed out by the Dealer to the Callee.

   message to the Callee:

       [UNREGISTERED, UNREGISTER.Request|id]

   where

   *  UNREGISTER.Request is the ID from the original request.

   _Example_

       [67, 788923562]

6.1.6.  Unregister ERROR

   When the unregistration request fails, the Dealer sends an ERROR
   message:

     [ERROR, UNREGISTER, UNREGISTER.Request|id, Details|dict, Error|uri]

   where

   *  UNREGISTER.Request is the ID from the original request.
   *  Error is a URI that gives the error of why the request could not
      be fulfilled.

   The execution of remote procedure calls is asynchronous, and there
   may be more than one call outstanding.  A call is called outstanding
   (from the point of view of the Caller), when a (final) result or
   error has not yet been received by the Caller.

6.2.1.  CALL

   When a Caller wishes to call a remote procedure, it sends a CALL
   message to a Dealer:

       [CALL, Request|id, Options|dict, Procedure|uri]

   or

       [CALL, Request|id, Options|dict, Procedure|uri, Arguments|list]

   or

       [CALL, Request|id, Options|dict, Procedure|uri, Arguments|list,
           ArgumentsKw|dict]

   where

   *  Request is a sequential ID in the _session scope_, incremented by
      the Caller and used to correlate the Dealer's response with the
      request.
   *  Options is a dictionary that allows to provide additional call
      request details in an extensible way.  This is described further
      below.
   *  Procedure is the URI of the procedure to be called.

   *  Arguments is a list of positional call arguments (each of
      arbitrary type).  The list may be of zero length.
   *  ArgumentsKw is a dictionary of keyword call arguments (each of
      arbitrary type).  The dictionary may be empty.

   _Example_

       [48, 7814135, {}, "com.myapp.ping"]

       [48, 7814135, {}, "com.myapp.user.new", ["johnny"],
           {"firstname": "John", "surname": "Doe"}]

6.2.2.  INVOCATION

   If the Dealer is able to fulfill (mediate) the call and it allows the
   call, it sends a INVOCATION message to the respective Callee
   implementing the procedure:

      [INVOCATION, Request|id, REGISTERED.Registration|id, Details|dict]

   or

      [INVOCATION, Request|id, REGISTERED.Registration|id, Details|dict,
          CALL.Arguments|list]

   or

      [INVOCATION, Request|id, REGISTERED.Registration|id, Details|dict,
          CALL.Arguments|list, CALL.ArgumentsKw|dict]

   where

   *  Request is a sequential ID in the _session scope_, incremented by
      the Dealer and used to correlate the _Callee's_ response with the
      request.
   *  REGISTERED.Registration is the registration ID under which the
      procedure was registered at the Dealer.

   _Example_

    [68, 6131533, 9823529, {}, ["johnny"], {"firstname": "John", "surname": "Doe"}]

6.2.3.  YIELD

   If the Callee is able to successfully process and finish the
   execution of the call, it answers by sending a YIELD message to the
   Dealer:

       [YIELD, INVOCATION.Request|id, Options|dict]

   or

       [YIELD, INVOCATION.Request|id, Options|dict, Arguments|list]

   or

    [YIELD, INVOCATION.Request|id, Options|dict, Arguments|list, ArgumentsKw|dict]

   The Dealer will then send a RESULT message to the original Caller:

       [RESULT, CALL.Request|id, Details|dict]

   or

       [RESULT, CALL.Request|id, Details|dict, YIELD.Arguments|list]

   or

6.2.5.  Invocation ERROR

   If the Callee is unable to process or finish the execution of the
   call, or the application code implementing the procedure raises an
   exception or otherwise runs into an error, the Callee sends an ERROR
   message to the Dealer:

     [ERROR, INVOCATION, INVOCATION.Request|id, Details|dict, Error|uri]

   or

    [ERROR, INVOCATION, INVOCATION.Request|id, Details|dict, Error|uri, Arguments|list]

   The Dealer will then send a ERROR message to the original Caller:

       [ERROR, CALL, CALL.Request|id, Details|dict, Error|uri]

   or

    [ERROR, CALL, CALL.Request|id, Details|dict, Error|uri, Arguments|list]

   If the original call already failed at the Dealer *before* the call
   would have been forwarded to any Callee, the Dealer will send an
   ERROR message to the Caller:

       [ERROR, CALL, CALL.Request|id, Details|dict, Error|uri]

   _Example_

       [8, 48, 7814135, {}, "wamp.error.no_such_procedure"]

7.  Security Model

   The following discusses the security model for the Basic Profile.
   Any changes or extensions to this for the Advanced Profile are
   discussed further on as part of the Advanced Profile definition.

   All WAMP implementations, in particular Routers MUST support the
   following ordering guarantees.

   A WAMP Advanced Profile may provide applications options to relax
   ordering guarantees, in particular with distributed calls.

7.1.  Ordering Guarantees

   *Publish & Subscribe Ordering*

   Regarding *Publish & Subscribe*, the ordering guarantees are as
   follows:

   If _Subscriber A_ is subscribed to both *Topic 1* and *Topic 2*, and
   _Publisher B_ first publishes an *Event 1* to *Topic 1* and then an
   *Event 2* to *Topic 2*, then _Subscriber A_ will first receive *Event
   1* and then *Event 2*. This also holds if *Topic 1* and *Topic 2* are
   identical.

   In other words, WAMP guarantees ordering of events between any given
   _pair_ of Publisher and Subscriber.

   Further, if _Subscriber A_ subscribes to *Topic 1*, the SUBSCRIBED
   message will be sent by the _Broker_ to _Subscriber A_ before any
   EVENT message for *Topic 1*.

   There is no guarantee regarding the order of return for multiple
   subsequent subscribe requests.  A subscribe request might require the
   _Broker_ to do a time-consuming lookup in some database, whereas
   another subscribe request second might be permissible immediately.

   *Remote Procedure Call Ordering*

   Regarding *Remote Procedure Calls*, the ordering guarantees are as
   follows:

   If _Callee A_ has registered endpoints for both *Procedure 1* and
   *Procedure 2*, and _Caller B_ first issues a *Call 1* to *Procedure
   1* and then a *Call 2* to *Procedure 2*, and both calls are routed to
   _Callee A_, then _Callee A_ will first receive an invocation
   corresponding to *Call 1* and then *Call 2*. This also holds if
   *Procedure 1* and *Procedure 2* are identical.

   In other words, WAMP guarantees ordering of invocations between any
   given _pair_ of Caller and Callee.

   There are no guarantees on the order of call results and errors in
   relation to _different_ calls, since the execution of calls upon
   different invocations of endpoints in Callees are running
   independently.  A first call might require an expensive, long-running
   computation, whereas a second, subsequent call might finish
   immediately.

   Further, if _Callee A_ registers for *Procedure 1*, the REGISTERED
   message will be sent by _Dealer_ to _Callee A_ before any INVOCATION
   message for *Procedure 1*.

   There is no guarantee regarding the order of return for multiple
   subsequent register requests.  A register request might require the
   _Broker_ to do a time-consuming lookup in some database, whereas
   another register request second might be permissible immediately.

7.2.  Transport Encryption and Integrity

   WAMP transports may provide (optional) transport-level encryption and
   integrity verification.  If so, encryption and integrity is point-to-
   point: between a Client and the Router it is connected to.

   Transport-level encryption and integrity is solely at the transport-
   level and transparent to WAMP.  WAMP itself deliberately does not
   specify any kind of transport-level encryption.

   Implementations that offer TCP based transport such as WAMP-over-
   WebSocket or WAMP-over-RawSocket SHOULD implement Transport Layer
   Security (TLS).

   WAMP deployments are encouraged to stick to a TLS-only policy with
   the TLS code and setup being hardened.

   Further, when a Client connects to a Router over a local-only
   transport such as Unix domain sockets, the integrity of the data
   transmitted is implicit (the OS kernel is trusted), and the privacy
   of the data transmitted can be assured using file system permissions
   (no one can tap a Unix domain socket without appropriate permissions
   or being root).

7.3.  Router Authentication

   To authenticate Routers to Clients, deployments MUST run TLS and
   Clients MUST verify the Router server certificate presented.  WAMP
   itself does not provide mechanisms to authenticate a Router (only a
   Client).

   The verification of the Router server certificate can happen

   1.  against a certificate trust database that comes with the Clients
       operating system
   2.  against an issuing certificate/key hard-wired into the Client
   3.  by using new mechanisms like DNS-based Authentication of Named
       Enitities (DNSSEC)/TLSA

   Further, when a Client connects to a Router over a local-only
   transport such as Unix domain sockets, the file system permissions
   can be used to create implicit trust.  E.g. if only the OS user under
   which the Router runs has the permission to create a Unix domain
   socket under a specific path, Clients connecting to that path can
   trust in the router authenticity.

7.4.  Client Authentication

   Authentication of a Client to a Router at the WAMP level is not part
   of the basic profile.

   When running over TLS, a Router MAY authenticate a Client at the
   transport level by doing a _client certificate based authentication_.

7.5.  Routers are trusted

   Routers are _trusted_ by Clients.  In particular, Routers can read
   (and modify) any application payload transmitted in events, calls,
   call results and call errors (the Arguments or ArgumentsKw message
   fields).

   Hence, Routers do not provide confidentiality with respect to
   application payload, and also do not provide authenticity or
   integrity of application payloads that could be verified by a
   receiving Client.

   Routers need to read the application payloads in cases of automatic
   conversion between different serialization formats.

   Further, Routers are trusted to *actually perform* routing as
   specified.  E.g. a Client that publishes an event has to trust a
   Router that the event is actually dispatched to all (eligible)
   Subscribers by the Router.

   A rogue Router might deny normal routing operation without a Client
   taking notice.

8.  Basic Profile URIs

   WAMP pre-defines the following error URIs for the *Basic Profile*.
   WAMP peers SHOULD only use the defined error messages.

   *Incorrect URIs*

   When a Peer provides an incorrect URI for any URI-based attribute of
   a WAMP message (e.g. realm, topic), then the other Peer MUST respond
   with an ERROR message and give the following _Error URI_:

       wamp.error.invalid_uri

   *Interaction*

   Peer provided an incorrect URI for any URI-based attribute of WAMP
   message, such as realm, topic or procedure

       wamp.error.invalid_uri

   A Dealer could not perform a call, since no procedure is currently
   registered under the given URI.

       wamp.error.no_such_procedure

   A procedure could not be registered, since a procedure with the given
   URI is already registered.

       wamp.error.procedure_already_exists

   A Dealer could not perform an unregister, since the given
   registration is not active.

       wamp.error.no_such_registration

   A Broker could not perform an unsubscribe, since the given
   subscription is not active.

       wamp.error.no_such_subscription

   A call failed since the given argument types or values are not
   acceptable to the called procedure.  In this case the Callee may
   throw this error.  Alternatively a Router may throw this error if it
   performed _payload validation_ of a call, call result, call error or
   publish, and the payload did not conform to the requirements.

       wamp.error.invalid_argument

   A message could not be delivered due to transport payload size
   limits.

       wamp.error.payload_size_exceeded

   *Session Close*

   The Peer is shutting down completely - used as a GOODBYE (or ABORT)
   reason.

       wamp.close.system_shutdown

   The Peer want to leave the realm - used as a GOODBYE reason.

       wamp.close.close_realm

   A Peer acknowledges ending of a session - used as a GOODBYE reply
   reason.

       wamp.close.goodbye_and_out

   A Peer received invalid WAMP protocol message (e.g.  HELLO message
   after session was already established) - used as a ABORT reply
   reason.

       wamp.error.protocol_violation

   *Authorization*

   A join, call, register, publish or subscribe failed, since the Peer
   is not authorized to perform the operation.

       wamp.error.not_authorized

   A Dealer or Broker could not determine if the Peer is authorized to
   perform a join, call, register, publish or subscribe, since the
   authorization operation _itself_ failed.  E.g. a custom authorizer
   did run into an error.

       wamp.error.authorization_failed

   Peer wanted to join a non-existing realm (and the Router did not
   allow to auto-create the realm).

       wamp.error.no_such_realm

   A Peer was to be authenticated under a Role that does not (or no
   longer) exists on the Router.  For example, the Peer was successfully
   authenticated, but the Role configured does not exists - hence there
   is some misconfiguration in the Router.

       wamp.error.no_such_role

9.  IANA Considerations

   WAMP uses the Subprotocol Identifier wamp registered with the
   WebSocket Subprotocol Name Registry
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/websocket/websocket.xhtml),
   operated by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).

10.  Conformance Requirements

   All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-
   normative, as are all sections explicitly marked non-normative.
   Everything else in this specification is normative.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as
   "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and abort these
   steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word
   ("MUST", "SHOULD", "MAY", etc.) used in introducing the algorithm.

   Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps MAY
   be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is
   equivalent.

10.1.  Terminology and Other Conventions

   Key terms such as named algorithms or definitions are indicated like
   _this_ when they first occur, and are capitalized throughout the
   text.
