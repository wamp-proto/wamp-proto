The status of the respective AP feature is marked as follow:

| Status | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| sketch | There is a rough description of an itch to scratch, but the feature use case isn't clear, and there is no protocol proposal at all.                                                                      |
| alpha  | The feature use case is still fuzzy and/or the feature definition is unclear, but there is at least a protocol level proposal.                                                                           |
| beta   | The feature use case is clearly defined and the feature definition in the spec is sufficient to write a prototype implementation. The feature definition and details may still be incomplete and change. |
| stable | The feature definition in the spec is complete and stable and the feature use case is field proven in real applications. There are multiple, interoperable implementations.                              |
